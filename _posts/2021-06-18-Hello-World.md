# Hello World!

## Why?

I'm creating this blog to document my time/journey through doing my Master's.

Partially to keep sanity during the Master's and partially to look back on it in the future.

 So yeah, buckle up!

 
- Hello World!
- ¡Hola mundo!
- Hallo Welt!
- Oi, mundo!
- Allinllachu pacha!
- Bonjour le monde!
- Salvê, orbs terrârum!
