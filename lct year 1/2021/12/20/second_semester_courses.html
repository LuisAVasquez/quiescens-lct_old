<p>Just after we finished our exams for the first semester, we started the second one. For those of us who were already burning out, this was very inconvenient. Honestly, I was not in a condition to study during the first week of the second semester...</p>
<p>Luckily for us, we had already asked the Coordinator of the local Master (not the LCT Coordinator!) through the student representatives to stop having the <a href="https://luisavasquez.github.io/quiescens-lct/lct%20year%201/2021/12/07/first_semester.html#Alternance"><em>Alternance</em></a> system, in order to have a lighter workload. Since none of us where working in a company or a lab under the <em>Alternance</em> system, the Coordinator agreed.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This is a Pure Mathematics course introducing the analysis of the efficiency algorithms. It covers a formal definition of algorithm, purposes of algorithms, famous algorithms, and limitations of algorithms.</p>
<p>Every two weeks there is a lecture, and between two lectures there is a tutorial session. After each lecture, a new worksheet is available. You have one week to turn it in. The worksheet will be solved in the tutorial session.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>

<li>Composition of Turing Machines</li>
<li>The Halting Problem</li>
<li>Algorithmic complexity</li>

<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A very difficult course</strong>:Most of the time most of our group didn't know what was going on on the whiteboard.
Rigorous proofs and mathematical reasoning are a big part of this course. Don't make the mistake of working alone on the worksheets: They are very long!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conceptual part of the course (formal algorithsm, Turing Machines, Halting problem) are tough to grasp for everyone. Luckily, there are tons of materials and tutorials available online. Sometimes the professor's slides or explanations were confusing for those without experience in the subject.</p>
<p>Something required for the course but not covered by it was the <em>computation of limits</em>. If you've taken an Introduction to  Calculus course, you should be fine, otherwise, start looking for tutorials online.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to ask your classmates for help, this is a very tough course!</p>

<p><strong>Very important course</strong>:You will learn how to build your own databases.
This course is the first of two modules covering Data Science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try to setup the software tools before the lectures or practical sessions, because many of us wasted too much time on that.</p>
<p>The last part of the course overalps with the Semantic Web course.</p>
<p>The exam was really though because web scrapping did not work for many of us.</p>
<p>The grading system was explained at the beginning of the course, but I don't remember it.</p>

<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Very important course</strong>:You will learn how to extract knowledge from data using the standard toolkit for NLP.
Conceptually, it is a heavy course. However, all of this concepts will follow you all along your NLP career, so give them time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The first exam covered pre-processing and everything except neural networks</li>
<li>The second exam convers neural networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>An issue is that all the neural network concepts is that it comes at the end of the course, reaching the end of the semester when we were all overloaded with homework and projects. It was difficult to give it the time it deserved.</p>
<p>The project consisting in mining Wikipedia articles from several categories, storing them in a database, and then use this to cluster them and train several classifiers trying to retrieve the original categories.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A very difficult course</strong>:Most of the time most of our group didn't know what was going on on the whiteboard.
Like the <em>Formal Logic</em> course from the first semester, this course mainly consists of rigurous definitions and proofs. Again, those students who had had experience with it had to coach everyone else for this course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had already studied most of these systems in the <em>Methods for NLP</em> course in the first semester, but only in an intuitive way.</p>
<p>The most important part is to learn to convert from one system to another, say, CFG to push-down automata. Get a hang of it by doing exercises.</p>
<p>The exam consists of exercises that are similar to the ones seen in class.</p>

<li>Creating speech corpora</li>

<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<p>The course was very disorganized. Each lecture did not have a connection to the previous ones, and we spent most of the practical sessions debugging Praat.</p>
<p>The homework was to record oneself talking and using Praat to analyse all the vowels and their formants, and writing a report on the results.</p>
<p>The project was to give a group presentation on a phonology paper from a list proposed by the teacher.</p>
<p>The exam was to explain concepts from creating spoken corpora, concepts from phonetics, and to manually analyse a spectrogram.</p>

<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This course is very heavy in theoretical linguistics!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This course has an associated course called "Syntactical structures".</p>
<p>IMO, the professor was the most organized one in the masters:he actually followed a syllabus and gave readings.
This course introduces so many linguistic courses that it is necessary to review them many times. The big picture of what the objective of the course is only becomes clear (at least to me) during the last month of lectures.</p>
<p>The readings are heavy, and sometime not all of them are relevant. I recommend re-reading the readings of the first weeks and also the ones for the last weeks. This is a luxury given the amount of load at the end of the semester, so be strategic about it.</p>
<p>The project is to make a lexical entry using a written corpus and the concepts from the course. The wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_function">Lexical functions</a> is really helpful as a model of what is expected for some parts of the entry.</p>
<p>This course is shared with the <em>Science du Langage</em> students.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Companion course to Lexicology, focusing on Dependency Syntax and Semantics. Several exercises are solved in each session.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parts of speech</li>
<li>Syntactic dependencies, trees</li>
<li>Semantic representations</li>
<li>Lexical functions</li>
<li>Syntactic coordination</li>
<li>Projectivity</li>
<li>Compound classes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<p>The main idea of the course is to learn to create semantic graphs (a representation of a meaning to be communicated), and use rules to transform them into syntactic trees (the utterances that express the graphs' meaning).</p>
<p>The course uses several linguistic concepts, but the examples help to clarify them quickly.</p>
<p>This course is shared with the <em>Science du Langage</em> students.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>An introduction to Knowledge graphs, how to create them, store them, query, and interconnect them. There are lectures and practical sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Web, HTTP requests</li>
<li>Resource Description Framework - RDF</li>
<li>SPARQL</li>
<li>RDF Schema, Description logics</li>
<li>Ontologies</li>
<li>Ontology reuse: Notable ontologies</li>
<li>Applications using Semantic Web</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<p>The course is about how one can use the principles behind the World Wide Web to not only store and share data, but also to store and share knowledge. By knowledge, we mean a way of representing facts (like "Nancy is a City in France") in a way that's understandable for computers. Really interesting course.</p>
<p>Each lecture starts with a review of the previous one, and that makes the course feel very repetitive.</p>
<p>The practical sessions are very useful to ground the concepts from the lecture. Try to install all the tools (Blazergraph, Protege) before the practical sessions!</p>
<p>The project consists on creating your own knowledge graph by mining and processing one from Wikidata or DBpedia. Then, you need to create a simple user interface to answer user questions, and an internal system that handels them and creates the appropriate query and presents the results to the user.</p>
<p>This course is shared with the Cognitive Science students.</p>

<p>The supervised project is a <strong>research project</strong> which lasts for the first <strong>year</strong>.</p>
<p>During the second semester you are supposed to implement and idea after you have done your litterature review during the first semester. You have to write a report of your idea and how you implemented it, and defend it in front of a jury.</p>
<p>We discovered that, even if we had reviewed the litterature decently well, we only knew about the methods in a theoretical way: we did not know how to write code to actually do what we wanted. This was a very common situation. In the case of my group, it took several months of trial and error with different ideas and software tools, in order to come up with a pipeline that we could make work.</p>
<p>For the defense of the project, you have to make slides and a poster.</p>
<p>Again, you should be having meetings with your supervisor every one or two weeks to report on your progress and ideas for the project.</p>
<p>Again, the workload of this project will depend a lot on your group dynamic and your supervisor. Some supervisors were very hands-off while others had a very specific roadmap. Some groups had everyone collaborate while some others had a single student doing all of the work.</p>

<p>The second semester was less heavy than the first one in terms of course hours because we were not using the <em>Alternance</em> system. However, in terms of project load it was more intense than the first one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, one has to balance whether all the courses and projects are worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, there is very little feedback from the professors about your performance (for example, we never got grades for our tutorial assignments), so you only know how well you've been doing when you get the final grade.</p>
<p>Again:&gt; Don't burn out!
