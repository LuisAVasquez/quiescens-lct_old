            "content": "What is Campus France? . . Every country has its own educational system. How can the French Government know if the requirements of one country match the requirements in France? This is what Campus France exists for. . Campus France is a service from the French Government dedicated to: . handling the applications of foreing students to French Universities. Since I was coming from an Erasmus Mundus program, I did not have to go through the proccess of applying through Campus France. | analyzing foreign academic qualifications (like university Diplomas) and decide on its equivalent in the French educational system. | . After deciding on the qualifications of a candidate, they emit a certificate, which is later used by the French embassy for the Visa application. . Not all countries must go through the Campus France process when applying for a French Visa. . My application steps: . In my case, getting the Campus France certificate for the Visa application took three steps . Contacting my local Campus France | Submitting my application via Études En France | Campus France interview | Waiting for the Certificate | . Contacting my local Campus France . This was a simple email to the Campus France Pérou explaining my situation. They gave me an overview of the process and important dates. Very helpful people. They were the ones to tell me to start my dossier in Études en France. . &#201;tudes en France . Études en France is an online platform for enrolling into French higher education. It helps you build your dossier (file). It is available in French, English, Spanish and Portuguese. . In their own words: . This platform was set up to make all you enrolment procedures in a French higher-ed program easier. It is completely dematerialized and helps you follow your procedures up until the visa request. Just create an account and follow the instructions! . . There are different procedures in case you are applying for the first time or if you have already been accepted to a French higher education institution. . In my case, since the LCT got me accepted into the Université de Lorraine, I had to go through the Je suis accepté(e) procedure. . The platform is decently designed and gives acceptably decent instructions. I remember having to fill in the following sections, uploading their respective documents . Personal information Passport | CV | . | Academic records . Transcript of records with an Apostille | Bachelor&#39;s Degree with an Apostille | . | Information about the Master . Acceptance letter | Scholarship letter | . | . Proof of French proficiency: I just selected &quot;None&quot; | Other: Proof of English proficiency: TOEFL | Scholarship letter | . | . A technicality . LCT students get to be registered as regular students in the universities where they study while they are studying. For example, I get to be registered as a student of the Université de Lorraine for the first year. . This means that, for the French educational system, the enrolment is made into the Université de Lorraine, so that&#39;s what one has to select in the Études en France platform. (This was confusing at the beginning because I kept looking everywhere in the platform for a &quot;LCT Master&quot; but could find none) . As it happens, in the French system, unlike other educational systems, Master&#39;s technically do not last two years. Instead, they are two educational programs of one year, the &quot;M1&quot; and the &quot;M2&quot;, which are supposed to be taken in sequence. . As I was going for my first year to the Université de Lorraine as an LCT student, technically I was getting into the M1 program. . All of this boils down to the fact that the Études en France platform, being from the French government, expects a French higher education program. I had to look up the official name of the program on the university website, which is the Master 1 Traitement Automatique des Langues at the IDMC (Institu des sciences du Digital) . Correcting the dossier . If you, like me, find out that you uploaded a wrong document or forgot to upload some document, don&#39;t panic. . It is very easy to correct the dossier. . If you have not yet submitted your dossier, the platform just lets you erase and reupload whatever you need. | If you have already submitted your dossier, write an email to your local Campus France explaining the mistake, and they&#39;ll reopen the platform for you. | . The good (and patient!) people at the Campus France Peru reopened the platform two times for me. . Campus France interview . If I remember correctly, it took approximately two months after my final submission on the Études en France platform to get an email for the interview. . Note that the processing fee, for me, was around 130 USD. . The interview itself was very light. Its objective is to verify your documents. . Because of the pandemic, my interview was online. Normally, it is only done in person and you have to take original documents with you. . The first part was them asking about my personal information and my Master program. . The most bureaucratic part of the interview is verifying your documents are real:I had to show my original academic records documents on webcam. They took their time to check the Apostilles. They did ask about my knowledge of French, but where satisfied with the fact that my studies were going to be in English. . After that, it became a light chat about life in France. Overall, it took 40 minutes. . Waiting for the Certificate . If I remember correctly, it was also around two months after the interview that I got the final approval from my local Campus France. . With this, the Ètudes en France platform allows you to download a very important document, the . . Accord préalable d&#39;inscription . Confirmation of acceptance/pre-enrollment . . . You will use the Accord préalable d&#39;inscription for applying for a French visa and for some bureaucracy in France. . And that was the end of my interaction with the whole Campus France system. Finally I could get apply for a French Visa. .",

Yet the uncertainty of the pandemic made it impossible to enjoy the news that much. . At this moment of the pandemic, no one knew if a vaccine was going to be possible, how long where borders going to be closed, nor if life was ever going to be the same. . For a couple of months we, the admitted students, received emails and attended meetings with the LCT Coordinator and Secretary. . No one knew what to do. . . Little by little, along the months, the new picture was starting to get clear: classes were going to be remote. . Problem 1: scholarships could only be given if you were inside the european union. | Problem 2: time zones would make it so many people had classes at impossible times. | . In my situation, most of my classes would have been after midnight, and for that, I would have to leave my job and thus have no income because I couldn&#39;t get to Europe because Peru closed its borders. . This situation was somewhat widespread among the admitted students for the LCT 2020 batch. . Finally, around June, the impasse was broken by an exceptional offer: . After many deliberations, the European Union decided that students admitted to Erasmus programs could defer their admissions for a year, and that scholarships would not be affected. . . Deferral . So, with a heavy heart, I deferred my studies for a year. . I kept my job and moved out of my parents house. .

After deciding I wanted to do a Master&#39;s degree and searching for a Master&#39;s to apply to, I finally had to actually apply to the LCT Master&#39;s. . . The LCT website has a dedicated platform for application. . Everything in this post is about the application for the 2020 student batch. (Because of COVID I had to defer) . To note: . The application opened around November 2019 and finished around February 2021. I applied two weeks before the final deadline. | At the time you apply to this Master&#39;s, simultaneously you&#39;re also applying for the Erasmus scholarship, you don&#39;t have to do a separate application. | The application consists of 7 steps. Each time you complete a step, you cannot go back, so be careful. If you make a mistake, you will have to leave the application halfway done, message the LCT contact (to be found in the website), and start the process again using a new email. | The application is completely online. If your original documents are not in English, you also need certified translations. | For the TOEFL, only official scores sent by ETS are accepted. | . . You should prepare all your documents . . Steps 1, 2, 3 . This steps are about your general information: . Passport, Bachelor&#39;s degree, transcript of courses, English certificate. . Step 4 . Here you give information about your academic background. . You specify which was your major, and make a summary of your course transcripts. . They&#39;ll ask you to pick up the courses that you think are relevant for the Master&#39;s, group them, and then estimate what percentage of the maximum note you achieved. . For example: I had three programming courses with their respective grades &quot;Intro to CS 18/20&quot;, &quot;C Language 17/20&quot;, &quot;Algorithms 11/20&quot;. . Thus I grouped them into a category &quot;CS&amp;Algorithms&quot; with percentage (90% + 85% + 55%)/3 = 76% . Additionally, in step 4 you specify your previous relevant experiences, be it work or research. . Step 5 . Here you, optionally, specify your preferred universities for the Master, but you also have to give a small argument about why you&#39;re preferring them. . Step 6 . In this part you specify the emails for your letters of reference. You need 2 contacts. . Step 7 . Here is where the Motivation Letter goes. . Additionally, you can specify further qualifications that may be relevant, like language certificates, scholarships, grants, etc. . You have to write a one line summary of the professional career you&#39;d like. . Hidden step: . Prepare a Residence certificate from your own country: This is an official document that states your address in your own country. In my country, luckily, one can fill a sworn declaration independently by filling a form online. Of course, this has to be translated to English. Every country has its own procedure for getting one of those. . Why is that necessary? For getting an scholarship, one has to certify the place where one was living, to determine the scholarship amount. This certificate needs to be dated before the application deadline for the master. . . Good luck! . .",

            "content": "General migration advise . From my experience traveling to a couple of places, here are the things that I&#39;ve found useful to know . Document everything . You don&#39;t want to loose an important document and re-do bureaucracy to get it again, right? . If some document is needed in any part of some bureaucracy for your trip, then take photocopies and/or scans with you. Do this as soon as you get the document, don&#39;t wait until you need the document in the future. Your future self will thank you. . A good file management system is a blessing, it has saved me in moment where I had to suddenly present a document. This is how I do it: For physical documents you could group them in different batches, use color coding, etc... while for digital documents you could organize them in folder by place and bureaucratic process. . For example: &quot;2021 Studies in Narnia Visa application Birth certificate with Narnian translation.pdf&quot; . This {website for working with PDFs](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/) has helped me a lot of times (merging, cutting, page extraction, compressing, etc). . Without good documentation: | . . With good documentation: | . . What&#39;s your name? . Different languages use different naming conventions for people. Find out how to put your name in the convention of where you are going, and stick to it. . . I&#39;ll give an example for Spanish into French. . . The Spanish language convention for names: . Shakira&#39;s name at birth was &quot;Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli&quot;. She&#39;s from Colombia, a Spanish speaking country, so she uses the Spanish language convention for names. . In this convention, a person&#39;s full name has four parts: two simple names and two family names. . A First name: Shakira | (Optional) One or more middle names: Isabel | A First family name, traditionally it&#39;s the First family name of the father: Mebarak | A Second family name, traditionally it&#39;s the First family name of the mother: Ripoli | To speak to someone: . in informal settings one just uses the first name: &quot;hey, Shakira!&quot;; | in semiformal settings (like a teacher in elementary school), one uses the first name and first family name: &quot;Hello, Shakira Mebarak!&quot;; | and in very formal settings or documents one uses the full name &quot;Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli&quot;. | . The French language convention for names: . French uses a different convention, a name (nom) consists of just two parts: a first name (prénom) and a family name (nom (de famille)). . Emannuel Macron&#39;s full name is Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fréderic Macron. . Here, the name is divided like this: . Prénom: Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fréderic | Nom (de famille): Macron | As we can see, the Prénom may contain many simple names. . From Spanish naming into French naming . So when Shakira wants to make a concert in France, how should she fill her taxes? . Here she could take advantage of the format of Passports. . Many Spanish speaking countries print their passports combining the First and Middle names into a single &quot;Simple Names&quot; field, and the First and Second family names into a single &quot;Family Names&quot; field. . Therefore, the conversion into the French format is natural: . She could use her First and Middle names together as a Prénom, and her First and Second family names as a Nom (de famille). . Shakira would fill her French taxes as follows: . Prénom: Shakira Isabel | Nom (de famille): Mebarak Ripoli | Note that this decision will have practical consequences for Shakira: While in Spanish the Middle names are rarely used, now she will have to use them very often for French bureaucracy. . In general, if you don&#39;t stick to the name you&#39;ve chosen for your target language, you will run into a lot of trouble because people will not be able to easily verify your identity. . Different Scripts . If your target country uses a different script than your home country for documents (Latin script, Arabic script, Cyrillic script, Greek script, Devanagari script, etc.), then you will have an extra layer of bureaucratic difficulty. . The most safe but expensive way to deal with this is to have official translations (maybe with an Apostille), see which conventions they use to transcribe/transliterate things like your name or the name of your university, and continue using them everywhere. . For example, from this Wikipedia entry, the common name &quot;Γιάννης&quot; can be written as Yannis, Jani, Ioannis, Yianis, or Giannis, but not Giannes. . | For example, the Russian naming convention includes a patronymic inside full names, and also uses the Cyrillic script! . | . As I said, you have to figure out the name you&#39;ll use abroad. . . Information Labyrinths . Government information is convoluted: . . Get ready to read everything at least three times. . . It will not make any sense by the first read. You&#39;ll be confused by the bureaucratic gibberish, the unhelpful forum posts, and the broken links. Little by little, you&#39;ll start to see how everything connects. . This is harder if you&#39;re going to a place that speaks another language. Even the most international-friendly countries have their websites with tons of links for information only available in the local language. . The most helpful method is to find someone who has already done what you did and wants to help, or to look for information online (like this blog!) . . Money talks . When talking about money we need to be serious. . Learn how to make an international transaction from your home country. Go to you bank and ask them for all the necessary paperwork. However, don&#39;t hesitate to ask around many banks and see which has a better deal for international transactions. . For example, in my country, very few banks work with Euros easily, so I had to search for one where I could at least save them without converting them into another currency. . Also, look for good places to exchange currency! In my experience banks tend to have the worst possible deals! I prefer currency exchange houses, one can ask around many of them to get a good deal. Virtual currency exchanges and using crypto are getting popular, but I&#39;ve not used them yet. . . Closing all you bank accounts when leaving is a bad idea . . They are useful for sending money back, and paying for local bureaucracy easily. So leave one or two accounts you can use. . How will your taxes work once you stop living in your home country? Is there anything you need to do to avoid being taxed? This information is important, and varies from place to place. For example, most countries don&#39;t tax their citizens once they are residents abroad, yet one of the big exceptions is the USA. . . Navigation apps . To get around, Google Maps is very trustworthy. It even lets you download maps for offline use! . For public transport, I&#39;ve found Moovit to be very well done. Instead of downloading a local app for each city you go to, Moovit has a decent summary of most cities. . . Miscellaneous . Find out the address format (for houses, mail, etc) of the place you&#39;re going to. . Check electricity specifications, like plug shape, voltage and frequency, to know if you&#39;ll need to buy adapters or transformers. Extensions are a good idea. . . Safe travels! . .",

            "content": "Writing a Motivation Letter . Get ready to do everything from scratch at least two times. . . You&#39;ll find a lot of advice and tricks on writing motivation letters, but that one was the most useful to me: It helped me get into the mindset for writing a motivation letter that really reflected what I wanted. . . At the end of this post I&#39;ll upload the Motivation Letters I used. . . What isn&#39;t a Motivation Letter for? . . A Motivation Letter isn&#39;t a document you use to trick the election committee into picking you. If you overstate or oversell something, they will know. Yet at the same time, don&#39;t undersell yourself. Be honest: you want them to see if you&#39;ll do well in the Master&#39;s, and if you really believe it, they&#39;ll see it through your writing. . It also is not a place to recount how well you did on your courses: that&#39;s what course transcripts are for! . What is a Motivation Letter for? . A motivation letter will show the election committee what you&#39;ve done, what you&#39;re abilities are, if there are notable parts of your academic history, how do you see the Master&#39;s program they&#39;re offering, and what do you plan to do with that. . . Part zero: Don&#39;t wait till last minute. . It is a common mistake to leave the Motivation Letter to the very end. That shows an lack of knowledge about the intensity of this step, and will lead to a bad motivation letter. . . . Part one: Discovering what you want . Don&#39;t jump to write your Motivation letter. . First you have to face the mirror. . Why do you want to pursue a Master&#39;s program? Are you ready to invest those two years? What for? What will you do if you don&#39;t get in? What career prospects do you expect? . These questions will accompany all the way till you hit &quot;Send&quot; on the application to the program, and will make you scrap and rewrite a lot. . Of course, you should not wait until you have an exact schedule of what you&#39;re going to do with your life, instead, the idea is to get a general sense of what you want for your future. . In my case, something that helped me discover this was to search in LinkedIn for the Alumni of the Master&#39;s programs that interested me. I could watch the life and career paths that different Master&#39;s programs opened and closed. This was more concrete information than, say, the Wikipedia overview of the topics of the Master&#39;s. . . Part two: The mindset . Think as if you were in the election committee: You have hundreds of motivation letters to read and grade, the ones who go on tangents, or mention very general things (e.g. &quot;I am good at abstract reasoning&quot;), won&#39;t make a good impression and will feel like a waste of time. . Be precise and concrete: point to real evidence that cannot be found in the other documents. . The only part where you&#39;re allowed to be kind of vague is when you explain your expectations for your future after the Master&#39;s. . . Personalize them: Ideally you&#39;ll write a different motivation letter for each master. . . To do this, you should have a general idea of what the university and the Master&#39;s offer. Even if two universities offer Master&#39;s with the same name, they&#39;ll have different strengths and weakness in research, industry presence, and study areas. So, check them out. . . Part three: Structure of the Motivation Letter . I&#39;ll go through this one by one. Depending on your writing style, group them in paragraphs as you see fit. . Don&#39;t lose the attention of the reader: Straight away tell them why are you applying and a general idea of what you want to learn and what to do with it. . | Give a general introduction to your background. Apart from mentioning your major, mention the things that don&#39;t appear on the other documents: research, academic, or university projects, activities, or events; how those activities impacted you and your abilities, and what particular academic path you&#39;ve been following. . | Talk a little about yourself. There are no other places where the election committee can get a glimpse into your personality. However, don&#39;t forget to relate it to the particular Master&#39;s program. . | Tell them about your current situation. Are you a student? When are you going to graduate from your Bachelor&#39;s? Have you already graduated? What&#39;s your job (if it&#39;s relevant to the program)? What have you learned recently (life-wise, not academic-wise) that can help you in the Master&#39;s? . | What would you like to do after finishing your Master&#39;s? This part shows them that you do intend to finish it! Do you want to pursue an academic or industry career? Do you not know yet? This in the only part where you are allowed to be vague or a little literary, but don&#39;t overdo it! . | . Part four: Improve and polish it . At some points you&#39;ll have to discard parts that took a lot time to write but that you can no longer fit in the letter, or maybe even discard the whole letter and start over. That&#39;s o.k., it&#39;s part of the process. . . Part five: Send it! . Good luck! . . . My samples . These are the motivation letters I sent to the Master&#39;s programs I applied to .

If you ask a professor, ideally it should be someone with whom you made a research project, or a mentor that knows you for many years, or your undergraduate thesis advisor, etc. If the only thing a professor can say about you is &quot;this person made good questions during class&quot; or &quot;this person had a cool final essay&quot;, then look for another professor. . If you ask someone from a job, you&#39;re trying on hard terrain. Your job should be relevant to the subject area of your Master&#39;s. You could ask your boss or a supervisor, but this person has to have credentials in the subject area of your Master&#39;s as well. On the upside, the election committee will know that someone from your job is concerned only about your real and tangible abilities to get things done, and will not lie to make you look good. . In my case, I asked four persons for letters of recommendation: three professors and one boss. . With the first professor I had made an undergraduate Math research project on Control Theory, and he was my mentor for some years. | With the second professor I took an intense one on one Graduate Algebra Seminar (no one else registered!) so he got to see me handling new and advanced topics. | With the third professor I was part of his reading circle on Linguistics, Logic, and Philosophy of Language for many years, so he knew my point of view regarding those topics, which were influential when I changed my major to Mathematics. | Finally, my boss was a physicist and worked as a senior programmer for many years, and he supervised me on a work project for a year. | . Additionally, I was strategic choosing which professors sent their recommendations to which universities. . For the more technical Master&#39;s programs I asked my math professors or my boss to send their recommendations; for the more interdisciplinary Master&#39;s programs I asked both my math and humanities (linguistics) professors to send their recommendations. . . Others: . GRE/GMAT . I have already explained that to me the GRE and the GMAT seem to be more a hassle to impede large numbers of students from applying, and that&#39;s why I chose to avoid Master&#39;s requiring either of them. However, it&#39;s still a kind of common request. . Diplomas . Documents indicating a good overall ranking in your graduation batch, or certificates of good performance in championships, competitions, bootcamps, etc, that make you look good could help your application, if they seem relevant to the election committee. They&#39;re not necessary, so send them only if you think they could help. . Some applications also ask for a High School Diploma, and in general, once accepted, European universities request them as well. . . Good luck! . .",

            "title": "What's an Apostille?",
            "content": "What&#39;s an Apostille? . Here&#39;s how I personally understand how Apostilles work. . The motivation . You live in a country called Pachaland, whose State issues its own official documents (like birth certificates, home ownership registries, etc....). . Within Pachaland, its own official documents are recognized: You get, say, a birth certificate at the Pachaland Citizen Registry, take it to the Pachaland Ministry of Education, and they&#39;ll accept it. . This is how countries usually work. . But what happens if you want to take your Pachaland documents to a foreign country, called Extrostan? . To the authorities of Extrostan, Pachaland documents are just pieces of paper with some ink. . Yet if the Extrostan authorities need some information about you that only Pachaland can give, how can they be sure you are presenting a real Pachaland document? . To solve this problem, a group of countries got together, and decided on the following: . &quot;Let us agree on a type of stamp we can all recognize, and let us attach this stamp to our own official documents!&quot; . This is the origin story of the Apostille. . . Apostilles . Physically, Apostilles are an adhesive stamp with a lot of security features. . Diplomatically, an Apostille from Pachaland on a Pachaland document basically says: . &quot;The Pachaland State hereby affirms that the document to which this Apostille is adhered, was issued/signed by a Pachaland Institution or Authority. We don&#39;t affirm that the content is true, though, just that we printed it.&quot; . Apostilles look like this: . (Example of a Peruvian Apostille, all names are fake) . . They&#39;re approx. 5 cm x 8 cm adhesive stamps, with usually the following data: . Name of the country | Who put his signature in this document? | What official position did that person have inside the State? | In which institution did that person work? | Where was this Apostille printed? | When was this Apostille printed? | By which authority was this Apostille printed? | Registration number of the Apostille | Seal with security features | Signature of the person (from the institution in 7) in charge of printing this Apostille. | So, a lot of official stuff. . Answers to question number 7 (who prints Apostilles?) vary from country to country. It could be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (like in Peru), local Justice Tribunals (like in Brasil), etc... each country has its own system (and costs!), but they will all in the end print the same format of Apostille. . Which documents can get an Apostille? . From what I know, there are four kinds of documents that can get an Apostille. . Documents issued by the State | Private documents (like a work or rent contract, etc....) that get some kind of State recognition (like being signed by a notary, etc....) | Certified copies of documents of kinds 1 or 2. | Official translations (with a registered translator) of documents of kinds 1, 2, and 3. | They&#39;ll paste one Apostille per document, even if it has many pages. Official translations get their own Apostille. . A real hustle. . My case . Getting an Apostille in Peru: . Step 1: Get your document (duh!) . | Step 2: Research who prints Apostilles and what&#39;s the procedure to get one. . | . In Peru, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prints all Apostilles. Luckily for me, Apostilles for documents from educational institutions (schools, universities, etc) are free. For all other documents the payment must me done at the National Bank before getting an Apostille. The Ministry has its price list on its website. . (being the Peruvian Government website, I&#39;ll cross my fingers to the link not getting broken) . Pre-covid, the Ministry had many offices spread around the city. You just had to get there to start the process. For one or two documents, some offices would be very quick and (after quickly paying at a National Bank module there), they would get your Apostilles in less than 30 minutes. For more documents you would have to wait a couple of hours, and for a lot of documents, just return the next day. Good times! . During covid, the Ministry only works in its central office. You have to get an appointment at their (shitty) website. But because of the demand, they open new appointment slots at random, and the appointments will be in two or three months! Terrible! I reserved my appointment in November 2020 for January 2021. Just terrible! . For some stupid reason, this process can only be paid in cash in Peru. . Example 1 . I Apostilled my birth certificate. This was very straightforward. . I got my birth certificate at the Citizen Registry (RENIEC, in Peru) | I went to one of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs offices | I paid and waited for a few minutes | Done | Example 2 . The process for my Bachelor&#39;s degree was not straightforward. . The issue: Bachelor&#39;s degrees are not issued by the Peruvian State, but by universities. . How to get an Apostille for them then? . Well, in Peru, I needed a Registration Certificate from the Peruvian Higher Education Authority (SUNEDU) saying that my Bacherlor&#39;s degree was in their registry. . Even though my Bachelor&#39;s degree was not issued by the Peruvian State, this Registration Certificate was, so it could get an Apostille! . So my whole process was . I got the physical Bachelor&#39;s degree | I got the Registration Certificate from the Peruvian Higher Education Authority | I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get an Apostille for the Registration Certificate | I paid and waited for a few hours (this was during covid) | Done | Luckily, getting the Registration Certificate can be done online now. . The people at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn&#39;t even look at my Bachelor&#39;s degree, just at the Registration Certificate, because for them the Registration Certificate was the only official document I gave them. . Final notes. . I&#39;ve actually never Apostilled an official translation, so I don&#39;t know if the original document should be Apostilled before or after the official translation. . Passports don&#39;t need Apostilles! . Depending on where one is going and what one is doing, the requirements will be different. For example, almost no one requests Apostilled documents from tourists. . Countries that are not part of the Apostille Convention, use Legalization. Basically, a Legalization says &quot;We pinky promise this document was issued by us&quot;. . What&#39;s the difference with an Apostille? Aren&#39;t both made with the same purpose? Yeah, they both intend to show that a document was really issued by a country, the difference is that Apostilles have a format and security features all countries in the Apostille Convention will recognize, while each country that uses Legalization (because they&#39;re outside the Convention) will have its own format, own security features, etc... . So I hope that give a general idea of what Apostilles are, and of the Kafkian ordeal it is to get an Apostille sometimes. . . . Sadly not-needless to say, this is not legal nor any kind of advice, just my personal story. Don&#39;t copy random strangers on the internet. . .",

            "title": "Searching for a Master's",
            "content": "Searching for a Master&#39;s to apply to . After deciding to do a Master&#39;s degree and before applying to some programs, I had to make a list of those Master&#39;s I would apply to. . Here&#39;s how I made my final list of four to five universities to study to. . This started one year before I actually applied to Master&#39;s programs. . This was a tedious part of the process, but it was my future what was at stake, so it was worth it. . Guiding principles . Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket: This is what I had in mind during this moment. . There&#39;s no guarantee the program of your dreams will have enough space, funding, or projects for you, so you need to diversify. Putting all your hopes into a dream program is a way of setting yourself up for disaster. . The more prudent way of doing it is to decide for many programs where you think you could be comfortable while studying a Master&#39;s degree of acceptable quality for you. I&#39;m not saying to have low-tier standards, instead I am saying that one has to be realistic: know thyself. . With that, here are the guiding principles for my search of Master&#39;s to apply to. . Places . From my personal history as well as future plans, I was sure I wanted to study in Europe, so I only looked for programs inside the countries of the European Union. . I&#39;m sure I missed a lot of good programs in the U.S.A, the U.K., Australia, Canada, Russia, and China, but that&#39;s the kind of compromise one has to make in order to fulfill some personal plans. . Luckily, there are a lot of universities to look at in the E.U. . Even luckier, the E.U. has Erasmus Master&#39;s, that take place in more than one country! I added those programs that either currently were Erasmus programs, or that had recently been Erasmus programs (because they tend to also have local funding). . . I made a Google Sheet of my own ranking of countries, from high (5) to low (1). . . Financial stuff . ABBA - Money Money, always a complicated issue.... . Not being rich, and having a middle-class family in a developing country like Peru, I could not finance a full study program + cost of living in Europe on my own. . Even though I had some savings from my work, I would have been barely enough for a year. . So I restricted my program search to two conditions: . Countries with (virtually) free education for non-europeans | Programs with (almost) full scholarships | . As for countries with virtually free education for non-europeans, that gave me . Germany | France | Belgium | Netherlands | Louxemburg | . The programs with (almost) full scholarships I had to search for in a university-by-university basis. . . Application requirements . There are some requirements that one can expect to always be requested, like proof of English proficiency. . However, other requirements, seem to be more a hassle to impede large numbers of students from applying: The GRE and the GMAT. . Though intended to somehow help admission offices, in reality, these exams are just a sham: there are courses and forums dedicated to passing them with good grades without actually being a knowledgeable student. . Additionally, preparation for taking those exams takes months, the exams themselves are somewhat expensive, and the conditions for sharing your grades for the applications processes you want are outright abusive. . These exams end up evaluating how much one has prepared for them. . For these reasons, I did not consider any programs that required either one of them, and oh, how much time and money have I saved! . . Available programs . By this time, I was thinking of going into Applied Mathematics (modelling, or PDEs. Very boring, I know). . Thus, I had to look up those universities that had Applied Mathematics programs. . . The legwork . With those guiding principles, my long search started. . Sources . I looked at two university rankings, filtered by country, and then searched for the top 15 to 20 universities in the country, for many European countries. . Also, I filtered by Area (Mathematics) and looked into the top 100 of them. . The rankings where: . The Shanghai ARWU ranking | The QS World University ranking | . . Screening process . Using the criteria of the guiding principles, I tried to make a list of those universities and programs that satisfied them. . At the beginning, for the first five universities I found, I tried to understand the whole application process, documents required, scholarship information, etc. Then I quickly noticed that that would not work: Every university had not only its own application criteria, but its own labyrinthine website. My strategy had to change. . My new method was to just quickly look at their available programs. . I wrote down on a Google Sheet all the universities that called my attention. I tried not to spent more than 10 minutes in a single university website. . BTW, French and German universities had the most disorganized and user unfriendly websites. . These took me around 3 months. I had to screen lots of universities. . The first list . My first list had around 100 surviving universities: . . The second list: More screening . From the first list, I started looking into their programs. I tried not to spend more than one hour in each university. This is where I filtered out those universities without applied math programs, and also those that asked for GRE/GMAT exams. . I also took a quick look at estimated prices, fees, and cost of living: . . Around thirty universities survived up to this point. . The final list: Refined filtering . With my second list ready, I started looking deep into the surviving universities&#39; programs: . Program: Courses, labs, projects, professors, etc. . Application process: Everything required to apply, even application fees. . In general: What programs seemed like a good fit for me, academically, financially, and personally. . The final list of Master&#39;s I decided to apply to was: . Mathmods: Joint Master in Mathematical Modelling in Engineering, in Germany, Italy, an/or France (As of 2020, it was an ex-Erasmus program with local funding) | COSSE: Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering, at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden, Germany, and/or the Netherlands. (As of 2020, it was an ex-Erasmus program with local funding) | Applied and Computational Mathematics: at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden. | Computational Science and Engineering: at Technische Universität Wien, in Austria. | . It took me months of screening to get to this point, but I really felt those places would be good for me. . You may notice something strange with that list, and I&#39;ll address it in the next section.... . . A surprise candidate . If you have read other parts of this blog, you surely have noticed something: . The Master&#39;s I ended up going to is not in the final list above! How could this be? . Here comes the story of how I ended up applying to the LCT Language and Communication Technologies Master&#39;s. . . The conversation . While traveling to meet friends abroad, I met a friend&#39;s friend who was a philosophy major with an interest in computing and we struck a conversation about the human Language potential. . We went about it for hours, eventually ignoring some of the other people around us. The topics ended up including philosophical logic, mathematical logic, foundations of mathematics, computation, linguistics, constructed languages, what the hell do A.I. and M.L do?, what&#39;s the role of proofs and programs? and so on. Eventually, he mentioned something called &quot;Computational linguistics&quot;, that nobody was quite sure what it meant, but it was a field in development. . This conversation made me realized that Applied Mathematics was something I could do, but that had moderate interest for me, and that my long dormant interest for languages was still there. Not only that, I was presented with a field that had a component from Humanities (through linguistics) and a component from mathematics (through programming), which was not Economics! (sorry, economists!) Even better, the field offered the chance to mix industry and research without necessarily going into academia. . . If I just could find a Master&#39;s in that area.... . The search . The conversation was in February 2020, and during the following days, I searched for Master&#39;s in Computational Linguistics. . After looking at the Erasmus Master&#39;s official list, I came across the LCT program. . It looked amazing for me, and it even had an scholarship! In a few hours I decided to apply. . I only had two weeks until the deadline! . Luckily, had already gotten my documents ready for the other applications (more info on getting documents ready in another post), so the effort of applying was minimal, and there was no application fee. . . The lesson . Was all my screening process worthless? . Not at all, it made clear to me what I expected from a Master&#39;s program to consider it at least decent. I got a feel of when a study path was not for me. . It helped me get ready for knowing about the most commonly requested documents. . The process made me realize that the Master&#39;s is a serious medium term project, and choosing well will influence a lot in my future. . And it gave me a list of satisfactory options for my future, and I avoided betting all into a single path. . . Note that at the end my list had now five candidates, and I prepared to apply to all of them. .",

            "content": "My journey to starting a Master&#39;s degree . I didn&#39;t just one day decide to apply to a Master&#39;s and got it. It was a long process. Let&#39;s see some of my journey before even applying to a Master&#39;s . During undergrad . Get good grades . It goes without saying, but good grades look really good in an application, but beyond that, ideally, they reflect that you learnt something during your undergrad, in the worst case, they reflect that you learnt to play the game of passing exams, but don&#39;t worry! Knowing how to play that kind of game will be helpful when navigating bureaucracy in the future! . Of course, unless they&#39;re truly astonishing, it is not enough to only have good grades. If you can show you can also do something, you&#39;ll have a better positioning than other students. I wish I had known this in the past. . . In my case, I was lucky that in professional Mathematics, the courses and exams in my university where made so that, if you passed them, it had to be because you at least learnt something. . Get undergraduate experience . You have to show you did something other than read books and pass exams. . Research can give you good experience during your undergraduate, this can also be activism or volunteering. In my case, I had a research project on Control Theory during my undergrad for some months. Don&#39;t be impressed, it was mainly about pointing out how there was a mistake in a proof by a not-that-well-known author. . Find out which areas you like . . Don&#39;t go in &quot;automatic mode&quot; passing courses, eventually, in your major, you&#39;ll find some things that pull your interest more than others, and that&#39;s ok, it&#39;s ok not to be a universal genius (sorry Leibniz, you put too much pressure on us mathematicians!). . In my case, I first studied Physics for some semesters before realizing that Mathematics was my thing, and even inside Math, I enjoyed far more algebra and logic than analysis (sorry again Lebiniz!). . . After undergraduate . . Work experience . . Ideally, your work will have something to do with the areas you got interested in during undergrad, or with the areas you intend to go to for your Master&#39;s. . Not everyone has the luck to have both, or even one. . In my case, my fist job did not start with either option. As I have detailed before, I started worked in Wolfram Research in a more Computer Science oriented project. Luckily, after a year or so, I could move into another project, more related with linguistics (and at this time I already had decided what Master&#39;s to apply to, but that will be for another post) I speculate that that helped me in my application process: There was concrete proof that someone trusted me with a project with an objective, deadlines, client requirements, etc, and that I did it (to the best of my ability). . Live . It was when my life did not revolve around my studies that I could better discern what I wanted to do with it. . Among scientists there&#39;s a bad custom of thinking your studies are your life (and internally your self-worth). This effectively destroys life-work/study balance, and is a recipe for missing on enormous amount of stuff. . Very curiously, it was while I was doing other hobbies that my mind was free of stress. And I say &quot;very curiously&quot; because my past self would devote everything to trying too hard to be too perfectionistic. . I then realized, I did not want to follow the predetermined route for mathematicians and scientists in general: . undergrad $ to$ master $ to$ doctorate $ to$ $N$ post-docs $ to$ tenure maaaaaaaybe . (&quot;$ to$&quot; means &quot; then immediately&quot;) . Nah, I wanted to do other stuff as well, not go into academia directly, and now I don&#39;t think I even want to go into it at all in the medium term. . Don&#39;t be too hard on yourself, follow a path not because it is the default, but because you chose to take it with the consequences it may have :) . So, hear my words: . . Quiêscere necesse est = to leisure is a necessity . . Andres Calamaro - Loco (Madman) . (chorus: I&#39;m a madman, that realized that time is too short) . Deciding I wanted to do a Master&#39;s degree . After my education I had a general base/idea of what different areas of Mathematics do. . But I felt like doing more than just the pure math I had been taught. . I felt like math should not be everything that I do, that I wanted to develop my other interests as well. . That meant I needed more training, so it was that I decided to do a Master&#39;s degree: in order to combine what I interested me with something math-related, and why not?, maybe get a better pay-grade with that. . Before this I thought about doing a Master&#39;s because &quot;it&#39;s what everyone here does&quot;, but now I had good personal reasons for doing it. . Thus I started searching for Master&#39;s. .",

I got accepted into the Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master, and many times I wonder if the committee made a mistake. Yep, impostor syndrome is my way of life for now. . . 1. My academic background . I studied at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the least catholic place in all of Peru and most forward thinking place in the country, a place truly dedicated to education, something remarkable when most universities in my country strive to be employee factories, but I digress.... . . My major was Mathematics. (wait, don&#39;t run!) . Though it was not my first option, I choose to major in Mathematics in order to learn how to learn, and along the way I worked a little in Control Theory, but my mathematical passion was in Mathematical Logic. One of the best decisions of my life :) . Now, you may think this makes a good segway into being good at Computer Science, but in fact I hated it. Or at least hated so much how it was taught to me, that I never bothered to learn it right. . In reality, I learned Mathematics through a &quot;pen and blackboard&quot; approach. Hopefully one day my professors will catch up with technology, but not in the foreseeable future. That&#39;s a result from the fact that being a mathematician is a very low-risk profession (I mean physically, not economically). . During my studies I got to do exchanges in Germany and Mexico, and summer courses in Brazil and U.S.A (funny, because summer in Brazil is from December to March, and in the USA it is from June to September) . All of this must sound amazing/impressive/intimidating, right? Well, only academically. My personal reality was really bad. For most of the time I was really depressed, my personal relationships where unattended, and I retracted to my own thoughts, which of course only worsened this cycle. . As it happens, doing Mathematics was a sort of good escapism: Reasoning about abstract concepts/objects helped me forget my problems and realize that there was beautiful stuff in life. . That must sound really strange, how can intangible stuff have an effect on someone? (that&#39;s a weird segway into Benacerraf&#39;s dilemma in the philosophy of Mathematics!) . The short version is that it was like looking at the sea for a long time: the vastness and uncaring-ness of what you&#39;re looking at is something that makes you realize that your problems are temporary, while the sea is not. . I also realized that Mathematics Academia was not a place for me: though I really like doing math, I also have other interests. I also wanted to have some savings before enrolling in graduate school, in order to not life off scholarships for many years. . And so, my graduation was at the end of 2018, with me not really knowing what I was going to do with my life. . . 2. Languages . Over the course of my life, I have always had an interest on human languages. When I was little, I would end up on Wikipedia for hours reading about how Basque is a language isolate, how some languages use clicks, constructed languages, reconstructed langauges, and so on, and on, and on.... . Being from the Peruvian coast, Spanish is my first language. The majority of Peruvians are monolinguals in Spanish, and so my upbringing was also like that. Sad, in a country with more than 30 indigenous languages. . First I studied English while I was around 13 to 16. My family insisted in registering me at a well-known English institute because of some non-sensical reasons like &quot;having a good CV&quot;. That institute was a waste of time and a money extractor for aspirational Peruvian families. I truly learned English watching stuff I really liked on Youtube, and then using English books for university. . For some years I tried to learn Ancient Greek at university. That&#39;s when I started attending classes at the Philosophy department. Though I studied really hard, I can hardly remember much now about the language itself, though it had it&#39;s advantages: . Greek made me go through the pain of learning a language with a case system, which was useful for the future | I&#39;m no longer intimidated by non-latin scripts | . Second I studied German when I was around 18. After a short 1-week journey to Germany I romanticized the country and wanted to study there in the future. That was the exchange I made when I was 21. Living there 6 months helped de-romanticize it, and I learned that every place has its own problems. . After studying German, the language-learning vice was already on motion. . Third I studied Quechua, the Ayacucho/Chanka variety, this is still in progress. Before you get surprised about that, after almost 4 years studying it on and off (too few people to get classes to open), I&#39;d say my level is still around A2-B1, keeping conversations is hard, I always forget the vocabulary, and can only read a couple of lines at a time. My reason for studying it was that I would not get a good chance to learn it if I left Peru. Learning it I saw the face of Peru that won&#39;t show on tourism ads: the social stigma against indigenous languages is strong in our classist peruvian society. I had to pay for the classes myself and I studied it in secret, because my parents had very strong negative opinions about that &quot;language of peasants&quot;. . Fourth I studied Portuguese. My main motivation here was that the program lasted a year and that that gave me a chance to study in Brazil. That was the summer course in made in Rio de Janeiro. Now, to many people that sounds idyllic, but the reality is different: Rio de Janeiro is the most unequal place I&#39;ve been to yet. Venturing outside the &quot;Zona Sul&quot; (South Zone, that&#39;s where all the famous beaches are) is where you&#39;ll see the true face of a strongly socioeconomically divided country. On the good side, long lasting friendships where made there :) . Fifth I started studying Latin, this is still in progress. My method is the wonderful Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata as a self learner. That&#39;s where I got the title for this blog btw, &quot;quiêscêns&quot; is the participle present of &quot;quiêscere&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;to relax, to leisure&quot;, so &quot;quiêscens&quot; means something like &quot;the one who relaxes/leisures&quot;. I&#39;m studying it because of all the tradition in philosophy and mathematics that&#39;s originally in Latin, but also as a relaxing exercise. . Sixth I started studying French, this is still in progress. To be honest, I have been indifferent to French culture all my life: I don&#39;t get why the media romanticizes it (specially USA media). Then, why did I started studying it? Well, I started after being accepted to my Master, the LCT program, and being assigned for my first year to the University of Lorraine. I&#39;ve then realized that the francophone countries of Africa look like really cool places to do some linguistics though. . . My goal is to get to be really fluent in 10 languages :) . 3. My work background . The three months after my graduation where very tense: my savings were diminishing and I needed to find a &quot;real job&quot;. . As it happens, some friends at university worked at Wolfram Research. After talking with some of the guys there, they recommended me to attend the Wolfram Summer School at Boston, USA. It lasted three weeks and was weirdly intellectually satisfying and socially challenging. The other participants were brilliant people from everywhere, and I made some lasting and non-lasting friendships there. The social issue was on me, because I put too much pressure on myself to &quot;keep up with the rest&quot;, which hindered my mental peace. Oh, how I wish I had known that! . After returning from the Summer School, I had an interview with the guy in charge of Wolfram Research South America, and the hired me. . . Those first months at Wolfram were very strong in imposter syndrome for me. I had no idea how to behave in a job environment, I had never programmed seriously (with a product for users in mind), and I got assigned a project strongly related to Computer Science (oh my!). . Thankfully, the environment and the people there were very relaxed, so my main source of stress was my own pressure to hide that I had no idea what I was doing. . With the months, I learned more and more, it was really in my second year that I got more confidence in my work. . That&#39;s when the pandemic arrived, and home-officing started. Working with all the mental load and uncertainty of the first months of quarantine was horrible. I hope never to be in that situation again. . After some months I asked to be relocated to a project more related to Linguistics, and my time there improved amazingly. Yeah, my algorithms where not very efficient, and some stuff had to be done manually, but I got it to work and even solved some bugs from many years ago! I did not notice the hours nor was as stressed as before in this new project. . Then, some weeks ago, I quit my job in order to make all the bureaucracy for starting the Masters. . 4. Choosing my masters . Though I will tell the complete story in another post, the summary is that I wanted to find a place where I could be &quot;in both worlds&quot; : Humanities + Sciences . I searched for a lot of places, like economics, to no result, I didn&#39;t really see myself doing that. . And one happy day, a friend told me about Computational Linguistics. This conversation started being about Logic and Philosophy of language, but when he started describing some ideas of the field, it was music to my ears. . In Computational linguistics I saw the chance to combine three interests . Humanities, through the social and philosophical sides from Linguistics | Sciences, through the Mathematics involved in technology (and that too many engineers gleefully are not aware of!) | Languages | . Plus the bonus of an allegedly good job market. . That&#39;s how I started searching for masters in Computational Linguistics, and eventually came upon Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master . 5. Holes in my formation . These are the things that I have meant to learn for a long time, because they would be helpful for my masters: . I have no idea about Python, R, or SQL | I have never done anything with machine learning | Computer Science (data structures and algorithms) make me wanna puke | Programming seriously is still very difficult for me | I don&#39;t have a formal education on Linguistics | I need more social confidence to work in groups | . I&#39;m really self-conscious about all of these. . Am I complaining that I have not yet learned the things I&#39;ll learn in the Masters? Sometimes I think that, but worrying about that kind of stuff is my specialty (not healthy, I know, I&#39;m working on it). . So yeah, that&#39;s partially me. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
