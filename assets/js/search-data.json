Technically, what one does it making the long-stay visa be equivalent to a residence permit. . . This process has to be done within the first three months of arriving to France. . . There is a small practical caveat for non-europeans! . Paying . The procedure cost me 50 €, there are two ways of paying for this procedure: . With a credit card | With an &quot;electronic stamp&quot; (timbre électronique) | . The problem is, you can only pay by credit card if it is a European credit card. I tried many times to make several credit cards work, but there was no success, and the same happened to the LCT students without a European bank account. . Getting an &quot;electronic stamp&quot; (timbre electronique) . An &quot;electronic stamp&quot; (timbre électronique) is a document used to pay procedures in France. . To buy one &quot;electronic stamp&quot; (timbre électronique), one must go to a tabac, a French convenience store, and ask for it. . In my case, there are many tabacs around Nancy and some close to my residence. When I arrived there I asked the tabac clerk for a timbre électronique pour valider la visa d&#39;étranger (electronic stamp for validating a foreigner&#39;s Visa), and then I payed the 50 € in cash. . The timbre électronique itslef is a small piece of paper with a code on it, which is necessary for the procedure online. . Note: . in the first tabac I visited the clerk had no idea what I was talking about (maybe my French pronunciation?), so I had to go to another one to get it done. | other students also asked the tabac clerks for a timbre pour titre pour étrangers (stamp for foreigner&#39;s permit) to get the same timbre électronique as me. | . The online platform . The website mentioned above told me to go to the platform for validating the Visa, also available in English, where one can find the option to validate the Visa. . . After clicking on that option, you will go through the steps of creating an account with an email, and giving some personal information. In their own words: . . They asked me for some codes printed in my Visa, the date on the seal I got from the migration officer at the airport, my address, and the code in the timbre électronique. . After finishing the process online, I waited for two days, after which I could sign in and download the certificate saying that my Visa had been validated as equivalent to a residence permit: . . . This document is required for bureaucracy later! . .",

Registering the French Visa | Getting a French phone number | Registering at the Université de Lorraine | Setting up a bank account. | Getting vaccinated against COVID in France | Registering into the French public health system | Applying for and getting housing subsidies | . And that&#39;s to be done independently of classes! That&#39;s why I arrived two weeks early to France: to have enough time for bureaucracy. . Additionally, since I did not know how long creating a bank account would take, I took a bunch of cash with me (around 2000 €). . In this post, I will just cover a simpler topic: getting groceries and house appliances during the first days. . You will find out that buying lunch and dinner daily in Nancy is not sustainable with a student budget, so, better start getting everything to cook at home soon! . Getting a cheap meal . Until you get your student card (and the student restaurants open), you will not be able to get student meals. Thus for the first weeks you will have to consider other options. . In Northern Europe, Turkish and Arabic fast food is cheap and easy to find. There are a couple of Kebab/Shawerma spots close to Residence Batelière. . Note that by &quot;cheap&quot; I mean around 7 € for each meal. . Just search &quot;kebab&quot; in Google Maps and you will find a bunch of them in the city. Around four kebab shops are within walking distance (&lt; 20 min.) from Batelière. . As I was getting groceries and house appliances for my room, I lived off Turkish food for around three days. . Getting groceries . There are a couple of supermarkets within reasonable distance of Residence Bateliêre. . Lidl is a European supermarket chain know for its very low prices, and luckily, there is one very close to the Residence Batelière, just two blocks away: | . They don&#39;t have much variety, but the prices are good and you can find there most of the basic stuff. . Plus, that specific Lidl close to Batelière is one of the few supermarkets that opens on Sunday (until midday)! . Carrefour is a French supermarket chain, they have more variety than Lidl but their prices are a little higher (not crazy high though). | . There is one Carrefour about four blocks away from Residence Bateliêre: . Finally, there is an ALDI, another European supermarket brand with cheap prices, about ten blocks away from the residence. | . Since their products are basically the same as those in Lidl, I never buy at that ALDI. . Nancy is a pretty walkable city, so I would recommend getting one of these trolleys for buying groceries: . . As time passed, I found out about other places to get good groceries, I will talk about it in a future post. . Getting house appliances . At a supermarket . The supermarkets close to the Residence Batelière are decent enough to get groceries, but to get house appliances at reasonable prices, you have to got to the big supermarkets (in French hypermachés). . Granted, getting there needs knowledge on using the . Auchan is a French supermarket chain, and it has one hypermarket at the edge of Nancy. As the city is small, it does not take long to get there (as it would in other cities). | . Here I could get some pots, dishes, utensils, spices, personal hygene items, bed sheets, and cleaning utensils. Actually, here&#39;s where I got the trolley that I mentioned before. . There is also GiFi, which is a domestic appliances stores. It is to the south of Nancy. | . Here, I could get bed sheets, brooms, a good knife, a mirror, a lamp, electric extensions, and some tools. . (Note, to get to GiFi I prefer to get the T2 bus line and then the T4) . At second hand stores . HappyCash is a second hand electronic appliances store. They sell them in decent condition for good prices. | . There is one HappyCash just next to the GiFi mentioned in the previous section (and half a block away there is an ALDI). . At HappyCash I could get phone chargers, USB cables, electric adaptors, etc. . From students leaving . There are a ton of university students coming to and moving out from Nancy. When they leave the city, they usually leave their stuff at a very good price. . The problem is knowing who is leaving what. . You may find Facebook groups, but it is easier to know from friends of friends. Of course, when I just arrived I didn&#39;t know anyone in the city. . As I mentioned before, some time before leaving Peru I joined a Whatsapp group of Peruvians coming to study in France at the time as me. Eventually I found out that a couple of them were also going to Nancy. It was through this friends that I found out about some students moving out and selling their stuff. . That&#39;s how I got some pots, a cutting board, and a microwave (for 15 €!) .",

Their openning hours are not great (get used to that from French public institutions): . . How to get to the Residence Bateli&#232;re? . Nancy happens to be a pretty walkable city (and also a very safe city!), so I could just take my luggage on foot to the Residence. . The main door can only be opened with a student card or by the staff at the residence reception. . Picking up the keys . I took one luggage first and I arrived to the residence before the time scheduled for my appointment, but they took me in anyway. The guy at the reception was a student on a summer job, and he spoke enough English to help me around. . I got two keys: . One room key | One mailbox key | . I also got a provisional student card which could only be used to get into the residence. I was told that after I got my own student card, I would have to return it to the reception. . The guy also gave me a list of the appliances in my room, so that I could check whether or not they were in a good state. I had to return that form filled in two days. . . Finally, and this is important for a lot of bureaucracy, I received a Certificate of Residence (Attestation de Residence), which officially certifies that I lived there and contained my full address. . . The room . As it happens, when I got to the residence (the last week of August), it was almost empty, most students arrive in the middle of October. Because of this, I was able to pick my room at the residence. . If you take a second look at the map above, you will see that there is a small river in front of the residence. I picked a room with a good view to the canal: . . Nice view! . . The rooms at Batelière are 18 square meters. Most other residence have rooms of 10 square meters! . . Let&#39;s take a look inside: . View from the main door: a long table and shelves to the left and a small kitchen to the right | . . View from the window: The long table and the shelves, a big closet behind the main door | . . The bathroom has a big bathtub (unlike other residences which only have small showers!) | . . The fridge: | . . After getting the room, I had to make a second trip to get my second luggage to the residence. . As it happens, the doors at Batelière have to be locked with a special move. After trying to figure it out for a while, I asked at the reception and the guy showed me how to do it. . He was also kind enough to tell me where I could find a supermarket and some restaurants close to the residence (I will cover that on a future post.) . Variations in the residence . I got to know this along the months I lived at Batelière. Even though most rooms are very similar, there are some subtle differences: . Most kitchens only have one electric stove, some have two! | Most kitchens have a tiny sink, some have a medium one | Most beds are fixed to the wall, occasionally some rooms will have a bed that can be moved around. | Some fridges do not have a freezer! | . The WiFi . The residence, as well as all the university buildings, uses the Eduroam network. This is a network shared by many universities in and out Europe. . Eduroam needs a registered user name and a password to connect to the Internet. Normally, students just use their university email. However, as I had just arrived, I could not connect to it. . . Pro-tip: you can ask for a provisional Eduroam account at the reception. . . I was lucky enough that, when I went down to the reception again to ask for help with the internet, they were 10 minutes from closing. . They gave me a provisional account and told me it could take a couple of hours until the database with the accounts updated. . I could only use the provisional account until I got my official account after registering at the university. . The rent . . As of 2021, the studio rooms at Bateliềre have a rent of 418 € per month. . . Other residences have prices between 200€ and 300€. . Even though the price is steep, all students, even non-european ones, are elligible to apply for student subsidies, a topic I will cover in a future post. . After getting the room . After getting the room, there is no time to waste for settling into a new life in France as a student of the University of Lorraine! . At this point I had to set up via email an appointment with the Administrative Coordinator to start my registration at the Université de Lorraine. They gave me an appointment for the following week. .",

            "content": ". A very intense day. (23rd to 24th of August of 2021) . . Before the airport . The night before the trip I managed to get my luggage in the acceptable weigth range and tried to sleep as much as possible. . On the day of the trip, I spent my morning giving my last farewells, had lunch at a good restaurant with my family, and tried to keep composture below all the stress of the uncertainty. . Luckily I had been doing lots of exercise the days before the trip, otherwise it would have been even more stressful. . . At the airport . . Some weeks before my trip, a friend who was also going to France added me to a Whatsapp group of Peruvian students leaving for France in the same semester. . Because of the small amount of flights due to COVID restrictions, it happened that some students were also going in the same flight as me. We decided to meet up at the airport. This was a very wise decision. . I arrived three hours before departure with all the necessary documents, and due to COVID restrictions, only passengers were allowed into the airport, so I had to say farewell to my family outside. . Luckily, I could meet up with two students in the check-in line. After that, we had a snack, went through security and got to the plane gate, where we met two more students. . In the plane . The plane was full of people moving to France (because Tourism trips were forbidden), and you could feel it in the atmosphere: most people had expressions of wearyness. . Anyway, the trip lasted 15 hours. . In my experience, window seats are the best for sleeping lol. . At the airport in Paris . . . The Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris is HUGE . . Getting around the airport takes a lot of time. . After getting out of the plane we had to walk for thirty minutes minutes to get to migration. There the line took almost one hour. None of us had any issue going through migration, but some had long delays at the luggage reclaim. My luggage took thirty more minutes to arrive, because of the amount of passengers in my flight. . Since some of the students had to take trains or buses soon, the group split. . After everyone in my group had their luggage, we headed to the train station inside the airport. . Getting a phone number at the airport . I am going to be clear: the price of SIM cards at the CDG airport is a rip-off. . Nevertheless, I discovered that getting a SIM card this early helped me doing some bureaucracy later. . I payed 40 € for a SIM card at a Relay shop at the CDG airport. It was a &quot;plug and play&quot; SIM card: just after inserting it I had internet data (20 GB). This was very useful for the rest of the trip for using Goolge Maps. . . Getting to the train station at the airport . One has to walk a lot to get to the train station at the CDF airport. . With two big luggages each, it took our group almost an hour to get to the train station after passing migration. . There our group dispersed, and only I and another student were getting on the same train (not getting off in the same city, though). . . It took 4 hours since I got off the plane until I got on the train . . I told you, Charles de Gaulle Airport is huge! . PD: If you see a bathroom, use it! You won&#39;t find another one in a long time (1€ coin or credit card to enter the bathroom). . . In the Train . . The way to get to the TGV is by looking for the gate at the CDG airport. . It came around 20 minutes before departure, and it got full fast. . I had reserved a seat, but the train was so big it took me time to find it. Before that I had to look for space two train cars to the side. . The trip was during the afternoon, and we quickly got to the French countryside. . . In the bus to Nancy . Finally the train got to the Lorraine TGV station, where I had 20 minutes to transfer to the bus to Nancy. . Luckily it was easy to find. There was a huge parking lot outside the station, but only two buses where there, one to Nancy and another to Metz. . . It was here where I had my first culture shock. . I had my QR code for my bus ticket reservation, but the bus driver couldn&#39;t scan it. Then he just said he believed me, and allowed me to get in the bus. . . In Nancy . Several weeks before arriving in Nancy, I got in contact with a student of the Master at the Université de Lorraine. . My bus was going to arrive when the reception of the student residence had already closed, so I was looking for a place to sleep until the next day. . This friend (lets call them $A$) was not in Nancy, but hey left me their keys with one of their friends (lets call them $B$). . Coming back to the day of my trip to France, I arrived to Nancy around 5 pm. . . So, $B$ picked me up at the bus stop and took me to $A$&#39;s room. $B$ started telling me about the city and the IDMC. . As it so happened, it started to rain just after steping off the bus, and it stopped when we were really close to $A$&#39;s room. My luck! . We ordered dinner on an app, and after talking for a while, $B$ had to go. As a small tour, I accompanied $B$ to their house and we managed to pass by different landmarks in Nancy and by the IDMC. . Luckily, since I had mobile data from the SIM I bought at the airport, I could use Google Maps to get back. . After getting back, I made calls to friends and family and went to sleep. . The next day I had to get to the Batelière Residence at 10 am to pick up my keys. . . Finally, after all that bureaucracy, I had arrived to Nancy to study . . My advise . These made the trip easier to bear: . Meet up with other people doing the same trip . Why do I say it was a wise decision? Because having someone around that is going through the same stressful process helped us share the burden. . Even though we didn&#39;t keep contact, we helped each other during the trip (navigating around, speaking French, etc.) . | . Buy a phone number at the French airport . Having a French phone number so early helped me get some bureaucracy done quicker . | . Have someone pick you up when you arrive . At the end of the tedious trip, it is easier to get guidance from someone that already knows the place . | .",

One week later the exemption certificate was available for download. . . The exemption certificate is needed for registration at the Université de Lorraine . . Plane ticket to Paris . I waited until having both my French visa and being accepted into a Student Residence to buy my plane ticket. . Those procedures finished one month before my departure, which increased the price of the plane ticket for me. Additionally, due to COVID, there were very few flights available. . Also due to COVID, the idea of making transfers was very unattractive, because each country had their own conditions for entry. Thus, I had to look up direct flights. . I ended up buying a 1000 USD plane ticket for an AirFrance flight from Lima to Paris. . Withouth a doubt, under pre-COVID conditions this would not have been so expensive. . My flight arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), which is huge. I needed to keep this in mind when buying tickets to get to Nancy. . Tickets to Nancy . The SNCF is the French public railway company. . In their website, also available in English, I bought my tickets to Nancy. . I bought tickets for the Highspeed train TGV (train à Grande Vitesse) and then transferred to a bus to Nancy, all for 70 € . My schedule was the following: . A TGV from CDG airport to the Lorraine-TGV station (between Nancy and Metz), around 3 hours. . | A bus from the Lorraine-TGV station to the Nancy Gare (Nancy main station), around half an hour. . | . According to that schedule, I would arrive in Nancy around 5pm. . The Lorraine TGV: . Nancy Gare: . Documents required at the Airport . Because of COVID, to enter France it was not enough to have a French Visa. Flights were restricted to those &quot;with a good reason for travelling&quot; and that were not at risk of having COVID. . The (printed) documents required to get into the flight were: . A PCR test with negative result done in the last 48 hours. I got it in a lab for around 60 USD. | A sworn declaration of having no COVID symptoms. | A sworn declaration saying I had good reasons for travelling (I selected &quot;Studies&quot;). | . These two last documents (in French!) could be downloaded from a website from the French Government, by Googling &quot;entrance to France for foreigners COVID&quot;. . Money exchange . Weeks before travelling, I started exchanging my money into Euros. I did it in medium sized batches of money, so I waited for moments with good exchange rates to exchange each batch. . I found one bank in my country that made international transfers in Euros at a flat rate: it was the same price independent of the amount of Euros sent! . However, I did not have a European bank account. Since I already had a trusted friend living in the European Union, me and them talked about the possibility of a transfer. I sent them the money in two batches, and each transfer took approximately four days to transfer. . Additionally, since I did not know how long creating a bank account would take, I took a bunch of cash with me (around 2000 €). . . Saying farewell . Most of the times when I was not doing any bureaucracy, I took to say goodbye to my friends in person. . The uncertainty of not knowing when (and if) I would see them again was heavy. .

            "content": ". Get ready to read this post many times at different moments of the procedure . . Getting accomodation in a Student Residence was my first experience with a French public service working within France.... and d*mn was it convoluted. Too many steps were only explained in French, some staff could not communicate in English, and the system itself sometimes doesn&#39;t make sense. . This is one of the information labytinths I mentioned before. . In this post, I will tell you how I did it, try to clarify some concepts, recount some issues I found along the way, and explain what was different for Erasmus Mundus students. . . All of this was done in parallel to the Visa Application process . . . Whas is CROUS? . In France, Universities and Institutes do not manage the Student Residences, they are managed by CROUS. . CROUS is the French public institution in charge of: . Student Residences | University dining halls | Cafeterias | Sports facilities | Some leisure events like concerts or art expositions | . You will make your application for a Student Residence to CROUS, you will pay your rent to CROUS, have your student lunch at CROUS dining halls, practice sports at CROUS facilities, etc. . You will be dealing with CROUS Lorraine. You can find their catalogue of residences (including prices) here. . Student Guide . The system is so weird, that the Université de Lorraine provides a guide in it&#39;s Website for international students, called Pas a Pas CROUS. Sometimes it is not easy to find in the website itself, so just Google universite de lorraine exchange student crous residence guide to find it. . You may think that this guide is complicated and not user friendly, but trust me, they are explaining the system in the simplest and most practical way possible. . Take a look at the overview of the process of applying to a university residence: . . . You can find my copy here . . Note that these instructions may have changed. . Some advise . Read the guide carefully, but don&#39;t panic. As you will see while you read this post. It is possible to overcome all the bureaucratic juggles and deadends, and having the local LCT Coordinator on your side helps a lot. . The first steps in the application process . Creating the account at Messervices.Etudiant is the first step. They will request the following documents: . Campus France Certificate (Accord préalable) | Admission letter from the Université de Lorraine | Erasmus Mundus scholarship letter | Passport | . After creating the account, you will get an INE: The INE is a number identifying you as a French student, and will be used to track your application. You will get it just after creating an account at Messervices.etudiant. . Wait some months, in my case, it was until almost the end of July, and if the CROUS accepted your application into a residence, you will have to pay 100€ within a week of receiving the news to reserve your place! . Some issues I had . I couldn&#39;t create my account at Messervices.Etudiant for many weeks because it expected a French phone number. I wrote emails to their helpdesk but never got a response. I asked around a lot and no one knew what to do. Eventually and miraculously, the website had a redesign, and it didn&#39;t ask me for a French phone number anymore, so I could finally create my account. . | Exchange rates suck for paying in Euros in my local currency. They are better if you get a local account in USD, and even better if you can get a local account in Euros (I managed to get an account in Euros in my country but it didn&#39;t allow for online payments). . | . Explaining the Garant and the Cautionemment . You will see these terms everywhere when you try to look for information on getting a CROUS residence. Here&#39;s what&#39;s necessary to know from a practical point of view. . The Garant is the person or institution who backs up your application financially: if you don&#39;t pay your rent, they will charge it to the Garant. . A person or institution expresses their desire to become your Garant by writting a Cautionemment agreement. . Simple, but no one takes the time to explain it. . What is Visale? Is it worth it? . Wherever you look for information about getting a CROUS residence, people will recommend you to use &quot;Visale&quot;. Even the guide mentioned before lists it as the first option for a Garant. . . Don&#39;t rush to get Visale! . . Visale is a service of the French government. Students who get Visale have the French State as their Garant. . The Visale loophole . . There is a particular situation preventing most foreign students to get Visale: . . Applying to Visale as a foreigner requires a French Visa . . I mentioned in a previous post that one option (&quot;Option 3&quot; in the post) for getting the proof of accomodation necessary for the Visa had a loophole. This is it. . If you try to go for Option 3, you will be in the following situation: . To get a French Visa you need to show a proof of accomodation | Option 3 means that your proof of accomodation will be the proof of acceptance into a CROUS Student Residence | Acceptance into a CROUS Student Residence requires a Garant | To get Visale as Garant, you need a French Visa | . . Breaking the loophole . After asking around to several past exchange students to France, within and outside Erasmus programs, apparently this is an issue that everyone encounters, which, I will add, makes it even more ridiculuous. . The way to break the loophole is to get a Garant that is not Visale. See the section below about special conditions for Erasmus Mundus students. . In my particular case . After having payed the 100€, I received the list of documents I had to send to my Residence (but ultimately couldn&#39;t. See the section below about special conditions for Erasmus Students). . 1 Reglement interieur and Conditions Particuli&#232;res . These documents are basically the rules of good conduct of the residence. I printed them, put my initials on every page, signed them, and scanned them into a PDF. . 2 D&#233;cision d&#39;admission . This is the document where the CROUS tells you are in the &quot;pre-accepted&quot; to get a room, and explain you some administrative rooms. I printed it, put my initials on every page, signed it, and scanned it into a PDF. . 3 Caution locative . This is the document declaring who is your Garant. See the section below about special conditions for Erasmus Mundus students. . 4 Identity and Bank account . This is a copy of your passport, together with a Bank account number. If you are not european, you probably don&#39;t have a bank account in the European system IBAN. . Provitionally they accepted my local bank account, but it is mandatory to provide them with an IBAN as soon as possible. . What I did was to get my local bank account number in a format suitable for international transfers, together with my bank&#39;s SWIFT-BIC code, and wrote a letter like this: . &quot;&quot;&quot; Messieurs du CROUS de Lorraine, Je vous écrive cette lettre pour vous informer de mon relevé d’identité bancaire. Dans ma condition d’étudiant étranger dans un programme Erasmus Mundus Master, j’utiliserai ce-relevé-ci jusqu’à je prenne un compte bancaire en France. Après ça, je vais mettre à jour mes données. SWIFT : &lt;My Bank&#39;s SWIRF&gt; Compte : &lt;My Bank account number&gt; Cordialement, &lt;My Name&gt; INE &lt;My INE&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;; . . which would be translated along the lines of: . &quot;&quot;&quot; Gentlemen from the CROUS Lorraine, I write you this letter to inform you of my bank account number. In my condition of foreing student in a Erasmus Mundus Master progra, I will use this banc account until I get a bank account in France. After that, I will update my information. SWIFT : &lt;My Bank&#39;s SWIRF&gt; Account : &lt;My Bank account number&gt; Greetings, &lt;My Name&gt; INE &lt;My INE&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;; . . 5 Insurance . House insurance is necessary to cover for damages in your own room. However, the CROUS requires a house insurance scheme that also includes Civil insurance, which covers possible damages you could make to the property of others. . There are many options, and after searching for a while I settled for a friend&#39;s recommendation of using ADH Assurance étudiants. It cost me around 30€ for a whole year, and it took me around 3 hours to set up and get a Attestation d&#39;Assurance (Insurance Certificate). . 6 Renseigement / Personal information . This is a document where CROUS asks for information about you . Personal Information | INE number | Academic Program (i.e. the M1 Master program) | Institution of the Program (i.e. the IDMC) | Your insurance&#39;s validity (point 4 above) | . I printed it, signed it, and scanned it into a PDF. . 7 Charte informatique . This is simply a document saying you will make responsible use of the internet at the Residence. I printed it, put my initials on every page, signed it, and scanned it into a PDF. . For Erasmus Mundus students . Some things where different for Erasmus Mundus students . Help from the Coordinator . The local LCT Coordinator at the Université de Lorraine helped us along the way. Months before our departure to France, he sent us some tables to fill with our preferences for a CROUS residence. At the end of the process, these where not that important because all the LCT students (both year 1 and year 2) got assigned to the same CROUS residence. . For my batch, this was Residence Batelière. . I have heard that in other years, LCT students have all been assigned to Residence Boudonville. . . In my batch at the Université de Lorraine, all LCT students got a CROUS residence, independent of whether or not they had a scholarship. . . Getting a Garant for the Cautionnement . The biggest help from the local LCT Coordinator was to determine who was going to be our Garant. The IDMC became our Garant, and the Coordinator sent us documents to include in the files we had to send by email. . In the system, but not really . Some days after having payed the 100€ to reserve a room, I got an email saying I had to send the documents enumerated above to my Residence within a week to get my final confirmation. . As we found out, this didn&#39;t work for us: they expected the documents to be sent by physical mail! Ridiculuous. . We took this up with the local LCT Coordinator, because there was no way for us to make it before the deadline (withouth paying a lot for a express post service, and even then, we would have to cross our fingers). Add to this the problem of being in the middle of the pandemic. . Eventually, the Coordinator managed to find an alternative process for us. We had to mail the files directly to the email of the Residence Batelière. We did it, but then they were taking long to answer and our travel dates where approaching, so one of the LCT students managed to find out who was in charge of assigning the rooms at the Residence Batelière, and we sent our files to that person. In a couple of days we got our final confirmations of acceptance into a CROUS residence. . . Note that I got my proof of acceptance into a CROUS residence after getting my French Visa. . . Arriving earlier . My Residence gave me the option of arriving earlier than the official start of my contract (which was the 1st of September of 2021). . In order to take this option, each of the extra days must be payed when you arrive (they tell you the price per night in an email). I took advantage of this and told them I would arrive a week earlier, at the end of August 2021. . . Even if you don&#39;t arrive earlier, it is necessary to schedule an appointment (via email) to pick up the keys in person. Check the opening ours of the reception office at the residence! . . More to do after arriving to the residence . Eventually, you have to give some additional documents to the administration at your residence. . Proof of enrollment in the Université de Lorraine (Certificat d&#39;escolarité) | IBAN Banc account number | . . You must pay a deposit when you pick up the keys. They accept payment by cash or by a European credit or debit card. . . The payment is done at the Residence&#39;s reception office just next to the main entrance. . Because I had no European bank account, I payed by cash. Note that this is the only payment they accept by cash, all posterior rent payments have to be done by card. .",

            "content": "Tip . Here&#39;s something I wish I new: . You can reserve an appointment at the French embassy independently of the status of your Campus France process (at least in my country.) . Because there was the pandemic, the queue at the French Embassy was huge, so one could only get appointments for two or three months in the future. Since I waited until I had my Campus France certificate (Accord préalable), the process took longer for me. . Of course, when you actually show up, you need to have all the documents for the Visa application. . Starting the online application . The Visa Application platform can be found in France-Visas, a French government website. It is the same platform for all countries and all types of Visa . I must admit that using the platform is very straightforward, and it allows you to partially fill your application and return later to complete it. . I will let them explain how to use it: . Step 1 | . . Step 2 | . . Read again: . . Important : All documents in languages other than French or English must be translated into French. . . In my case, the supporting documents where: . The admission letter to the Université de Lorraine | The Erasmus Mundus scholarship letter | The proof of insurance given by the LCT Master | Campus France Certificate/ Acoord préalable | . Getting an appointment . Each French Embassy in each country has a different method for booking appointments. Check the Country of application page . As I mentioned, due to the pandemic the appointments where given for two or three months into the future. First, I got an appointment that was going to be two months into the future, then, by checking the platform of the French Embassy in my country every day, I got to book an appointment one month and a half into the future (maybe someone else cancelled?). . . Finishing the online application . After getting a date for the appointment, you have to log in again to the Visa Application platform, go to the step where you left your application, and check on I already have an appointment (or something like that). . Then, you will get a list of all the documents you need to take to the French Embassy. . Necessary documents . These are the documents the French Embassy in my country told me to get for my Visa appointment: . The Visa Application From from the platform. | Passport | Photocopy of your complete passport (even the empty pages!) in color. | Campus France Certificate / Accord Préalable d&#39;inscription | ID Photo in european (biometric) format. (I got mine done at a Photograpy studio for around 10 USD. They already knew what I meant.) | Proof of residence, for those who are applying in a country different than their country of nationality. (Not my case) | Proof of resources: The scholarship letter. Note that Erasmus students don&#39;t have to pay for the Visa application! (For France, it would have been 100 € in my country) | . | Proof of insurance valid in France: the LCT program provided insurance. (This is not the same as travel insurance!) | Proof of accomodation: See below | . Proof of accomodation . To get a Visa, the French Embassy needs to know that you will have a place to stay. . So, how to get this? I found out about three ways to go about this. . Option 1: Letter from the Coordinator . This is by far the easiest way of getting something that you can give to the French Embassy. I didn&#39;t know about it until after my Visa appointment and I really wish I had. . Basically, you ask the LCT Local Coordinator in France to write a letter, or to modify the Admission Letter to the University of Lorraine, saying that they promise to get you accomodation. . Option 2: Promising you will look for accomodation . This is the option I took. . Basically, one writes a letter in French to the Consul at the French Embassy saying that you&#39;ll be at a specific place while you wait for your definitive residence. . I booked a room at a hotel in Nancy for two weeks at booking.com, with free cancellation. After I got my Visa, I cancelled the reservation. . Before reading the letter, note: . &quot;CROUS&quot; is the name of the French insitution in charge of Student Residences. More to be explained in a future post. | I only booked for two weeks because that was the longest period the website allowed. | I printed and attached the booking confirmation to my dossier. | . My letter to the French consul was: . &quot;&quot;&quot; &lt;My name&gt; &lt;My address&gt; &lt;My City&gt; Le &lt;Date&gt; Objet : lettre explicative concernant les conditions de mon hébergement en France les trois premiers mois de mon séjour. Monsieur le consul, Je prends la liberté de vous fournir quelques explications relatives à mes conditions d’hébergement en France durant les trois premiers mois de mon séjour. Durant cette période, je serai hébergé à l’hôtel &lt;Name of the hotel&gt; se trouvant à l’adresse suivante &lt;Address of the hotel&gt; et dont le numéro de téléphone est &lt;telephone number of the hotel&gt;, le temps de me voir attribuer une chambre dans une résidence universitaire par l’intermédiaire du CROUS. Dans l’hypothèse où j’obtiendrais une réponse négative de la part du CROUS, je me mettrai à la recherche d’un appartement à louer dans le secteur privé, en passant par une agence immobilière ou un site de petites annonces et ce en utilisant mes moyens financiers personnels. Je joins à la présente ma réservation d’hôtel. Même si maintenant ma réservation est pour deux semaines, dans l’hypothèse où j’obtiendrais une réponse négative de la part du CROUS, je le prolongerais de trois mois. Je vous prie d’agréer, Monsieur le Consul général, l’expression de ma respectueuse considération. &lt;Signature&gt; __________________________ &quot;&quot;&quot;; . . A translation (Remember the letter must be sent in French!) would be along the lines of: . &quot;&quot;&quot; &lt;My name&gt; &lt;My address&gt; &lt;My City&gt; On the &lt;Date&gt; Subject: Explanation letter regarding the conditions of my accomodation in Frence during the first three months of my stay Mr. consul, I am taking the liberty of providing you some explanations concerning my accomodation conditions in France during the first three months of my stay. During this period, I will be lodged at the hotel &lt;Name of the hotel&gt; which can be found at the following address &lt;Address of the hotel&gt; and whose phone number is &lt;telephone number of the hotel&gt; during the time that it takes for me to receive a room at a student residence via the itermediary CROUS. In the case where I were to obtain a negative response from CROUS, I will start searching for an accomodation to rent on the private sector, either through an immobiliary agency or through a renting website, using my personal financial means. I attach to this letter my hotel reservation. Even if now my reservation is only for two weeks, in the case where I were to obtain a negative response from CROUS, I will extend it for three months. I ask you to accept, Mr General Consul, my respectful greetings &lt;Signature&gt; __________________________ &quot;&quot;&quot;; . . Option 3: Proof of acceptance into a Student Residence . This is a nightmare. . You will find online that this is the standard procedure for getting a proof of accomodation. It is very long and convoluted, you will have to do it at some point so that you actually get into a Student Residence, but it is possible to apply for the visa without it (see Options 1 and 2 above). . This issue will have it&#39;s own post, but in summary, there is a bureacractic loophole that makes going through the standard process of applying to a student residence very difficult for those who are not already residing in France. . All the LCT Students of my batch tried to do it for months, but we gave up. Ultimately most went for Option 1. . In my case, I tried to get to use this option unsuccessfully, and while searching online for alternatives, I found out about Option 2 in an official website of the French Government. That&#39;s why I went for Option 2. If I had known Erasmus Mundus students had Option 1 available, I would have used that one. . The appointment at the French embassy . Be on time . . The French Embassy in my country had very unconvenient opening hours: . They only took visa applications for one hour and a half each day, only during the mornings. | They had not updated their opening hours on their website, luckily I got early enough so that this was not a problem. | . The appointment itself was very smothly.... until I realised I had forgotten to print one document and had to run to a printing shop for it. Luckily, since I had the earliest appointment, when I returned I was still on time to leave the missing document. . . They checked all my documents and took them in. Then they waved the Visa application fee because I was an Erasmus student. . Finally, I was told to wait at least one month for the answer and received a ticket to pick up my passport. . You can track your application on the Visa Application platform! . The final answer . It took the French Embassy around six weeks to get back to me with the final answer. . . I got it! . . . Important to note: . . My Visa had a validity of one year from August 2021 to July 2022. . . and, . . I got the French Visa on July 2021, one month and a half before leaving to France . . finally, . This was the end of my interaction with the French Embassy in my country. . Again, note that requirements vary by country and that many things were different due to the pandemic .",

            "content": "What is Campus France? . . Every country has its own educational system. How can the French Government know if the requirements of one country match the requirements in France? This is what Campus France exists for. . Campus France is a service from the French Government dedicated to: . handling the applications of foreing students to French Universities. Since I was coming from an Erasmus Mundus program, I did not have to go through the proccess of applying through Campus France. | analyzing foreign academic qualifications (like university Diplomas) and decide on its equivalent in the French educational system. | . After deciding on the qualifications of a candidate, they emit a certificate, which is later used by the French embassy for the Visa application. . Not all countries must go through the Campus France process when applying for a French Visa, for example, Canada has their own procedure. . My application steps: . In my case, getting the Campus France certificate for the Visa application took three steps . Contacting my local Campus France | Submitting my application via Études En France | Campus France interview | Waiting for the Certificate | . Contacting my local Campus France . This was a simple email to the Campus France Pérou explaining my situation. They gave me an overview of the process and important dates. Very helpful people. They were the ones to tell me to start my dossier in Études en France. . &#201;tudes en France . Études en France is an online platform for enrolling into French higher education. It helps you build your dossier (file). It is available in French, English, Spanish and Portuguese. . In their own words: . This platform was set up to make all you enrolment procedures in a French higher-ed program easier. It is completely dematerialized and helps you follow your procedures up until the visa request. Just create an account and follow the instructions! . . There are different procedures in case you are applying for the first time or if you have already been accepted to a French higher education institution. . In my case, since the LCT got me accepted into the Université de Lorraine, I had to go through the Je suis accepté(e) procedure. . The platform is decently designed and gives acceptably decent instructions. I remember having to fill in the following sections, uploading their respective documents . Personal information Passport | CV | . | Academic records . Transcript of records with an Apostille | Bachelor&#39;s Degree with an Apostille | . | Information about the Master . Acceptance letter | Scholarship letter | . | . Proof of French proficiency: I just selected &quot;None&quot; | Other: Proof of English proficiency: TOEFL | Scholarship letter | . | . A technicality . LCT students get to be registered as regular students in the universities where they study while they are studying. For example, I get to be registered as a student of the Université de Lorraine for the first year. . This means that, for the French educational system, the enrolment is made into the Université de Lorraine, so that&#39;s what one has to select in the Études en France platform. (This was confusing at the beginning because I kept looking everywhere in the platform for a &quot;LCT Master&quot; but could find none) . As it happens, in the French system, unlike other educational systems, Master&#39;s technically do not last two years. Instead, they are two educational programs of one year, the &quot;M1&quot; and the &quot;M2&quot;, which are supposed to be taken in sequence. . As I was going for my first year to the Université de Lorraine as an LCT student, technically I was getting into the M1 program. . All of this boils down to the fact that the Études en France platform, being from the French government, expects a French higher education program. I had to look up the official name of the program on the university website, which is the Master 1 Traitement Automatique des Langues at the IDMC (Institute des sciences du Digital) . Correcting the dossier . If you, like me, find out that you uploaded a wrong document or forgot to upload some document, don&#39;t panic. . It is very easy to correct the dossier. . If you have not yet submitted your dossier, the platform just lets you erase and reupload whatever you need. | If you have already submitted your dossier, write an email to your local Campus France explaining the mistake, and they&#39;ll reopen the platform for you. | . The good (and patient!) people at the Campus France Peru reopened the platform two times for me. . Campus France interview . If I remember correctly, it took approximately two months after my final submission on the Études en France platform to get an email for the interview. . Note that the processing fee, for me, was around 130 USD. . The interview itself was very light. Its objective is to verify your documents. . Because of the pandemic, my interview was online. Normally, it is only done in person and you have to take original documents with you. . The first part was them asking about my personal information and my Master program. . The most bureaucratic part of the interview is verifying your documents are real:I had to show my original academic records documents on webcam. They took their time to check the Apostilles. They did ask about my knowledge of French, but where satisfied with the fact that my studies were going to be in English. . After that, it became a light chat about life in France. Overall, it took 40 minutes. . Waiting for the Certificate . If I remember correctly, it was also around two months after the interview that I got the final approval from my local Campus France. . With this, the Ètudes en France platform allows you to download a very important document, the . . Accord préalable d&#39;inscription . Confirmation of acceptance/pre-enrollment . . . You will use the Accord préalable d&#39;inscription for applying for a French visa and for some bureaucracy in France. . And that was the end of my interaction with the whole Campus France system. Finally I could get apply for a French Visa. .",

At this moment of the pandemic, no one knew if a vaccine was going to be possible, how long where borders going to be closed, nor if life was ever going to be the same. . For a couple of months we, the admitted students, received emails and attended meetings with the LCT Coordinator and Secretary. . No one knew what to do. . . Little by little, along the months, the new picture was starting to get clear: classes were going to be remote. . Problem 1: scholarships could only be given if you were inside the european union. | Problem 2: time zones would make it so many people had classes at impossible times. | . In my situation, most of my classes would have been after midnight, and for that, I would have to leave my job and thus have no income because I couldn&#39;t get to Europe because Peru closed its borders. .

Each time you complete a step, you cannot go back, so be careful. If you make a mistake, you will have to leave the application halfway done, message the LCT contact (to be found in the website), and start the process again using a new email. | The application is completely online. If your original documents are not in English, you also need certified translations. | For the TOEFL, only official scores sent by ETS are accepted. | . . You should prepare all your documents . .

Here you give information about your academic background. . You specify which was your major, and make a summary of your course transcripts. . They&#39;ll ask you to pick up the courses that you think are relevant for the Master&#39;s, group them, and then estimate what percentage of the maximum note you achieved. . For example: I had three programming courses with their respective grades &quot;Intro to CS 18/20&quot;, &quot;C Language 17/20&quot;, &quot;Algorithms 11/20&quot;. .

Additionally, you can specify further qualifications that may be relevant, like language certificates, scholarships, grants, etc. . You have to write a one line summary of the professional career you&#39;d like. . Hidden step: . Prepare a Residence certificate from your own country: This is an official document that states your address in your own country. In my country, luckily, one can fill a sworn declaration independently by filling a form online. Of course, this has to be translated to English. Every country has its own procedure for getting one of those. . Why is that necessary? For getting an scholarship, one has to certify the place where one was living, to determine the scholarship amount. This certificate needs to be dated before the application deadline for the master. . . Good luck! . .",

            "content": "General migration advise . From my experience traveling to a couple of places, here are the things that I&#39;ve found useful to know . Document everything . You don&#39;t want to loose an important document and re-do bureaucracy to get it again, right? . If some document is needed in any part of some bureaucracy for your trip, then take photocopies and/or scans with you. Do this as soon as you get the document, don&#39;t wait until you need the document in the future. Your future self will thank you. . A good file management system is a blessing, it has saved me in moment where I had to suddenly present a document. This is how I do it: For physical documents you could group them in different batches, use color coding, etc... while for digital documents you could organize them in folder by place and bureaucratic process. . For example: &quot;2021 Studies in Narnia Visa application Birth certificate with Narnian translation.pdf&quot; . This {website for working with PDFs](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/) has helped me a lot of times (merging, cutting, page extraction, compressing, etc). . Without good documentation: | . . With good documentation: | . . What&#39;s your name? . Different languages use different naming conventions for people. Find out how to put your name in the convention of where you are going, and stick to it. . . I&#39;ll give an example for Spanish into French. . . The Spanish language convention for names: . Shakira&#39;s name at birth was &quot;Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli&quot;. She&#39;s from Colombia, a Spanish speaking country, so she uses the Spanish language convention for names. . In this convention, a person&#39;s full name has four parts: two simple names and two family names. . A First name: Shakira | (Optional) One or more middle names: Isabel | A First family name, traditionally it&#39;s the First family name of the father: Mebarak | A Second family name, traditionally it&#39;s the First family name of the mother: Ripoli | To speak to someone: . in informal settings one just uses the first name: &quot;hey, Shakira!&quot;; | in semiformal settings (like a teacher in elementary school), one uses the first name and first family name: &quot;Hello, Shakira Mebarak!&quot;; | and in very formal settings or documents one uses the full name &quot;Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli&quot;. | . The French language convention for names: . French uses a different convention, a name (nom) consists of just two parts: a first name (prénom) and a family name (nom (de famille)). . Emannuel Macron&#39;s full name is Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fréderic Macron. . Here, the name is divided like this: . Prénom: Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fréderic | Nom (de famille): Macron | As we can see, the Prénom may contain many simple names. . From Spanish naming into French naming . So when Shakira wants to make a concert in France, how should she fill her taxes? . Here she could take advantage of the format of Passports. . Many Spanish speaking countries print their passports combining the First and Middle names into a single &quot;Simple Names&quot; field, and the First and Second family names into a single &quot;Family Names&quot; field. . Therefore, the conversion into the French format is natural: . She could use her First and Middle names together as a Prénom, and her First and Second family names as a Nom (de famille). . Shakira would fill her French taxes as follows: . Prénom: Shakira Isabel | Nom (de famille): Mebarak Ripoli | Note that this decision will have practical consequences for Shakira: While in Spanish the Middle names are rarely used, now she will have to use them very often for French bureaucracy. . In general, if you don&#39;t stick to the name you&#39;ve chosen for your target language, you will run into a lot of trouble because people will not be able to easily verify your identity. . Different Scripts . If your target country uses a different script than your home country for documents (Latin script, Arabic script, Cyrillic script, Greek script, Devanagari script, etc.), then you will have an extra layer of bureaucratic difficulty. . The most safe but expensive way to deal with this is to have official translations (maybe with an Apostille), see which conventions they use to transcribe/transliterate things like your name or the name of your university, and continue using them everywhere. . For example, from this Wikipedia entry, the common name &quot;Γιάννης&quot; can be written as Yannis, Jani, Ioannis, Yianis, or Giannis, but not Giannes. . | For example, the Russian naming convention includes a patronymic inside full names, and also uses the Cyrillic script! . | . As I said, you have to figure out the name you&#39;ll use abroad. . . Information Labyrinths . Government information is convoluted: . . Get ready to read everything at least three times. . . It will not make any sense by the first read. You&#39;ll be confused by the bureaucratic gibberish, the unhelpful forum posts, and the broken links. Little by little, you&#39;ll start to see how everything connects. . This is harder if you&#39;re going to a place that speaks another language. Even the most international-friendly countries have their websites with tons of links for information only available in the local language. . The most helpful method is to find someone who has already done what you did and wants to help, or to look for information online (like this blog!) . . Money talks . When talking about money we need to be serious. . Learn how to make an international transaction from your home country. Go to you bank and ask them for all the necessary paperwork. However, don&#39;t hesitate to ask around many banks and see which has a better deal for international transactions. . For example, in my country, very few banks work with Euros easily, so I had to search for one where I could at least save them without converting them into another currency. . Also, look for good places to exchange currency! In my experience banks tend to have the worst possible deals! I prefer currency exchange houses, one can ask around many of them to get a good deal. Virtual currency exchanges and using crypto are getting popular, but I&#39;ve not used them yet. . . Closing all you bank accounts when leaving is a bad idea . . They are useful for sending money back, and paying for local bureaucracy easily. So leave one or two accounts you can use. . How will your taxes work once you stop living in your home country? Is there anything you need to do to avoid being taxed? This information is important, and varies from place to place. For example, most countries don&#39;t tax their citizens once they are residents abroad, yet one of the big exceptions is the USA. . . Navigation apps . To get around, Google Maps is very trustworthy. It even lets you download maps for offline use! . For public transport, I&#39;ve found Moovit to be very well done. Instead of downloading a local app for each city you go to, Moovit has a decent summary of most cities. . . Miscellaneous . Find out the address format (for houses, mail, etc) of the place you&#39;re going to. . Check electricity specifications, like plug shape, voltage and frequency, to know if you&#39;ll need to buy adapters or transformers. Extensions are a good idea. . . Safe travels! . .",

            "title": "Writing a Motivation Letter",
            "content": "Writing a Motivation Letter . Get ready to do everything from scratch at least two times. . . You&#39;ll find a lot of advice and tricks on writing motivation letters, but that one was the most useful to me: It helped me get into the mindset for writing a motivation letter that really reflected what I wanted. . . At the end of this post I&#39;ll upload the Motivation Letters I used. . . What isn&#39;t a Motivation Letter for? . . A Motivation Letter isn&#39;t a document you use to trick the election committee into picking you. If you overstate or oversell something, they will know. Yet at the same time, don&#39;t undersell yourself. Be honest: you want them to see if you&#39;ll do well in the Master&#39;s, and if you really believe it, they&#39;ll see it through your writing. . It also is not a place to recount how well you did on your courses: that&#39;s what course transcripts are for! . What is a Motivation Letter for? . A motivation letter will show the election committee what you&#39;ve done, what you&#39;re abilities are, if there are notable parts of your academic history, how do you see the Master&#39;s program they&#39;re offering, and what do you plan to do with that. . . Part zero: Don&#39;t wait till last minute. . It is a common mistake to leave the Motivation Letter to the very end. That shows an lack of knowledge about the intensity of this step, and will lead to a bad motivation letter. . . . Part one: Discovering what you want . Don&#39;t jump to write your Motivation letter. . First you have to face the mirror. . Why do you want to pursue a Master&#39;s program? Are you ready to invest those two years? What for? What will you do if you don&#39;t get in? What career prospects do you expect? . These questions will accompany all the way till you hit &quot;Send&quot; on the application to the program, and will make you scrap and rewrite a lot. . Of course, you should not wait until you have an exact schedule of what you&#39;re going to do with your life, instead, the idea is to get a general sense of what you want for your future. . In my case, something that helped me discover this was to search in LinkedIn for the Alumni of the Master&#39;s programs that interested me. I could watch the life and career paths that different Master&#39;s programs opened and closed. This was more concrete information than, say, the Wikipedia overview of the topics of the Master&#39;s. . . Part two: The mindset . Think as if you were in the election committee: You have hundreds of motivation letters to read and grade, the ones who go on tangents, or mention very general things (e.g. &quot;I am good at abstract reasoning&quot;), won&#39;t make a good impression and will feel like a waste of time. . Be precise and concrete: point to real evidence that cannot be found in the other documents. . The only part where you&#39;re allowed to be kind of vague is when you explain your expectations for your future after the Master&#39;s. . . Personalize them: Ideally you&#39;ll write a different motivation letter for each master. . . To do this, you should have a general idea of what the university and the Master&#39;s offer. Even if two universities offer Master&#39;s with the same name, they&#39;ll have different strengths and weakness in research, industry presence, and study areas. So, check them out. . . Part three: Structure of the Motivation Letter . I&#39;ll go through this one by one. Depending on your writing style, group them in paragraphs as you see fit. . Don&#39;t lose the attention of the reader: Straight away tell them why are you applying and a general idea of what you want to learn and what to do with it. . | Give a general introduction to your background. Apart from mentioning your major, mention the things that don&#39;t appear on the other documents: research, academic, or university projects, activities, or events; how those activities impacted you and your abilities, and what particular academic path you&#39;ve been following. . | Talk a little about yourself. There are no other places where the election committee can get a glimpse into your personality. However, don&#39;t forget to relate it to the particular Master&#39;s program. . | Tell them about your current situation. Are you a student? When are you going to graduate from your Bachelor&#39;s? Have you already graduated? What&#39;s your job (if it&#39;s relevant to the program)? What have you learned recently (life-wise, not academic-wise) that can help you in the Master&#39;s? . | What would you like to do after finishing your Master&#39;s? This part shows them that you do intend to finish it! Do you want to pursue an academic or industry career? Do you not know yet? This in the only part where you are allowed to be vague or a little literary, but don&#39;t overdo it! . | . Part four: Improve and polish it . At some points you&#39;ll have to discard parts that took a lot time to write but that you can no longer fit in the letter, or maybe even discard the whole letter and start over. That&#39;s o.k., it&#39;s part of the process. . . Part five: Send it! . Good luck! . . . My samples . These are the motivation letters I sent to the Master&#39;s programs I applied to .

            "content": "General documents for applying for admission into a Master&#39;s . No matter which Master&#39;s one has searched for, there are some documents that most Master&#39;s programs require. . Proof of language proficiency . If your program is in English, TOEFL or IELTS are usually accepted, and each program has its minimum grade requirements. . I took the TOEFL, which in 2019 cost about 200 USD . . Bachelor&#39;s Degree . This certifies that you finished your undergraduate students. . Some specific countries may have a degree between a Bachelor and a Master&#39;s degree. For example, Peru has a &quot;licensing&quot; process to get a Licensed Degree. This kind of processes are not necessary to apply abroad. . I had to get my Bachelor&#39;s degree translated and apostilled. . Note, some universities, like mine, can also issue certified copies of a Bachelor&#39;s degree. This can also be useful to get. . . Transcript of courses . This is a list with all your grades from your undergraduate years. It is very helpful if it includes a note explaining the grading system at your university. . If you made and exchange abroad during your undergrad, then the transcript from those courses could also help you in your application. Imagine the election committee wondering &quot;Hey, why didn&#39;t this person take such and such course? Ah, this person took it abroad, nice!&quot;. . I had to get my transcripts translated and apostilled. . Motivation letter . A letter explaining your background, and why you want to pursue the Master. It should be written separately for each university you&#39;re applying to. . Writing the motivation letter deserves its own post. . The good thing, is that election committees do look at motivation letters, unlike others.... . . Curriculum Vitae . Even this should be tailored to each specific program. Add, remove, and reorder the items in your CV to fit the Master&#39;s you&#39;re applying to. . For example, if you have an educational background in one area, and work experience in another area, then you can order them putting first the one most relevant to the Master&#39;s. . Some Master&#39;s have length limitations (usually two pages) for CVs. . . Recommendation letters . Usually two recommendation letters are requested. . They should be written by people with whom you have actually worked and that know and have evidence of your abilities. . If you ask a professor, ideally it should be someone with whom you made a research project, or a mentor that knows you for many years, or your undergraduate thesis advisor, etc. If the only thing a professor can say about you is &quot;this person made good questions during class&quot; or &quot;this person had a cool final essay&quot;, then look for another professor. . If you ask someone from a job, you&#39;re trying on hard terrain. Your job should be relevant to the subject area of your Master&#39;s. You could ask your boss or a supervisor, but this person has to have credentials in the subject area of your Master&#39;s as well. On the upside, the election committee will know that someone from your job is concerned only about your real and tangible abilities to get things done, and will not lie to make you look good. . In my case, I asked four persons for letters of recommendation: three professors and one boss. . With the first professor I had made an undergraduate Math research project on Control Theory, and he was my mentor for some years. | With the second professor I took an intense one on one Graduate Algebra Seminar (no one else registered!) so he got to see me handling new and advanced topics. | With the third professor I was part of his reading circle on Linguistics, Logic, and Philosophy of Language for many years, so he knew my point of view regarding those topics, which were influential when I changed my major to Mathematics. | Finally, my boss was a physicist and worked as a senior programmer for many years, and he supervised me on a work project for a year. | . Additionally, I was strategic choosing which professors sent their recommendations to which universities. . For the more technical Master&#39;s programs I asked my math professors or my boss to send their recommendations; for the more interdisciplinary Master&#39;s programs I asked both my math and humanities (linguistics) professors to send their recommendations. . . Others: . GRE/GMAT . I have already explained that to me the GRE and the GMAT seem to be more a hassle to impede large numbers of students from applying, and that&#39;s why I chose to avoid Master&#39;s requiring either of them. However, it&#39;s still a kind of common request. . Diplomas . Documents indicating a good overall ranking in your graduation batch, or certificates of good performance in championships, competitions, bootcamps, etc, that make you look good could help your application, if they seem relevant to the election committee. They&#39;re not necessary, so send them only if you think they could help. . Some applications also ask for a High School Diploma, and in general, once accepted, European universities request them as well. . Criminal records . If you need to apply for an internship at some point, they will probably ask for a Criminal record. Normally, you can get them at your Embassy abroad, but it is normally easier to get them in your own country, and have them Apostilled! . . Good luck! . .",

            "title": "What's an Apostille?",
            "content": "What&#39;s an Apostille? . Here&#39;s how I personally understand how Apostilles work. . The motivation . You live in a country called Pachaland, whose State issues its own official documents (like birth certificates, home ownership registries, etc....). . Within Pachaland, its own official documents are recognized: You get, say, a birth certificate at the Pachaland Citizen Registry, take it to the Pachaland Ministry of Education, and they&#39;ll accept it. . This is how countries usually work. . But what happens if you want to take your Pachaland documents to a foreign country, called Extrostan? . To the authorities of Extrostan, Pachaland documents are just pieces of paper with some ink. . Yet if the Extrostan authorities need some information about you that only Pachaland can give, how can they be sure you are presenting a real Pachaland document? . To solve this problem, a group of countries got together, and decided on the following: . &quot;Let us agree on a type of stamp we can all recognize, and let us attach this stamp to our own official documents!&quot; . This is the origin story of the Apostille. . . Apostilles . Physically, Apostilles are an adhesive stamp with a lot of security features. . Diplomatically, an Apostille from Pachaland on a Pachaland document basically says: . &quot;The Pachaland State hereby affirms that the document to which this Apostille is adhered, was issued/signed by a Pachaland Institution or Authority. We don&#39;t affirm that the content is true, though, just that we printed it.&quot; . Apostilles look like this: . (Example of a Peruvian Apostille, all names are fake) . . They&#39;re approx. 5 cm x 8 cm adhesive stamps, with usually the following data: . Name of the country | Who put his signature in this document? | What official position did that person have inside the State? | In which institution did that person work? | Where was this Apostille printed? | When was this Apostille printed? | By which authority was this Apostille printed? | Registration number of the Apostille | Seal with security features | Signature of the person (from the institution in 7) in charge of printing this Apostille. | So, a lot of official stuff. . Answers to question number 7 (who prints Apostilles?) vary from country to country. It could be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (like in Peru), local Justice Tribunals (like in Brasil), etc... each country has its own system (and costs!), but they will all in the end print the same format of Apostille. . Which documents can get an Apostille? . From what I know, there are four kinds of documents that can get an Apostille. . Documents issued by the State | Private documents (like a work or rent contract, etc....) that get some kind of State recognition (like being signed by a notary, etc....) | Certified copies of documents of kinds 1 or 2. | Official translations (with a registered translator) of documents of kinds 1, 2, and 3. | They&#39;ll paste one Apostille per document, even if it has many pages. Official translations get their own Apostille. . A real hustle. . My case . Getting an Apostille in Peru: . Step 1: Get your document (duh!) . | Step 2: Research who prints Apostilles and what&#39;s the procedure to get one. . | . In Peru, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prints all Apostilles. Luckily for me, Apostilles for documents from educational institutions (schools, universities, etc) are free. For all other documents the payment must me done at the National Bank before getting an Apostille. The Ministry has its price list on its website. . (being the Peruvian Government website, I&#39;ll cross my fingers to the link not getting broken) . Pre-covid, the Ministry had many offices spread around the city. You just had to get there to start the process. For one or two documents, some offices would be very quick and (after quickly paying at a National Bank module there), they would get your Apostilles in less than 30 minutes. For more documents you would have to wait a couple of hours, and for a lot of documents, just return the next day. Good times! . During covid, the Ministry only works in its central office. You have to get an appointment at their (shitty) website. But because of the demand, they open new appointment slots at random, and the appointments will be in two or three months! Terrible! I reserved my appointment in November 2020 for January 2021. Just terrible! . For some stupid reason, this process can only be paid in cash in Peru. . Example 1 . I Apostilled my birth certificate. This was very straightforward. . I got my birth certificate at the Citizen Registry (RENIEC, in Peru) | I went to one of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs offices | I paid and waited for a few minutes | Done | Example 2 . The process for my Bachelor&#39;s degree was not straightforward. . The issue: Bachelor&#39;s degrees are not issued by the Peruvian State, but by universities. . How to get an Apostille for them then? . Well, in Peru, I needed a Registration Certificate from the Peruvian Higher Education Authority (SUNEDU) saying that my Bacherlor&#39;s degree was in their registry. . Even though my Bachelor&#39;s degree was not issued by the Peruvian State, this Registration Certificate was, so it could get an Apostille! . So my whole process was . I got the physical Bachelor&#39;s degree | I got the Registration Certificate from the Peruvian Higher Education Authority | I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get an Apostille for the Registration Certificate | I paid and waited for a few hours (this was during covid) | Done | Luckily, getting the Registration Certificate can be done online now. . The people at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn&#39;t even look at my Bachelor&#39;s degree, just at the Registration Certificate, because for them the Registration Certificate was the only official document I gave them. . Final notes. . I&#39;ve actually never Apostilled an official translation, so I don&#39;t know if the original document should be Apostilled before or after the official translation. . Passports don&#39;t need Apostilles! . Depending on where one is going and what one is doing, the requirements will be different. For example, almost no one requests Apostilled documents from tourists. . Countries that are not part of the Apostille Convention, use Legalization. Basically, a Legalization says &quot;We pinky promise this document was issued by us&quot;. . What&#39;s the difference with an Apostille? Aren&#39;t both made with the same purpose? Yeah, they both intend to show that a document was really issued by a country, the difference is that Apostilles have a format and security features all countries in the Apostille Convention will recognize, while each country that uses Legalization (because they&#39;re outside the Convention) will have its own format, own security features, etc... . So I hope that give a general idea of what Apostilles are, and of the Kafkian ordeal it is to get an Apostille sometimes. . . . Sadly not-needless to say, this is not legal nor any kind of advice, just my personal story. Don&#39;t copy random strangers on the internet. . .",

After deciding to do a Master&#39;s degree and before applying to some programs, I had to make a list of those Master&#39;s I would apply to. . Here&#39;s how I made my final list of four to five universities to study to. . This started one year before I actually applied to Master&#39;s programs. . This was a tedious part of the process, but it was my future what was at stake, so it was worth it. . Guiding principles . Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket: This is what I had in mind during this moment. . There&#39;s no guarantee the program of your dreams will have enough space, funding, or projects for you, so you need to diversify. Putting all your hopes into a dream program is a way of setting yourself up for disaster. . The more prudent way of doing it is to decide for many programs where you think you could be comfortable while studying a Master&#39;s degree of acceptable quality for you. I&#39;m not saying to have low-tier standards, instead I am saying that one has to be realistic: know thyself. . With that, here are the guiding principles for my search of Master&#39;s to apply to. . Places . From my personal history as well as future plans, I was sure I wanted to study in Europe, so I only looked for programs inside the countries of the European Union. . I&#39;m sure I missed a lot of good programs in the U.S.A, the U.K., Australia, Canada, Russia, and China, but that&#39;s the kind of compromise one has to make in order to fulfill some personal plans. . Luckily, there are a lot of universities to look at in the E.U. . Even luckier, the E.U. has Erasmus Master&#39;s, that take place in more than one country! I added those programs that either currently were Erasmus programs, or that had recently been Erasmus programs (because they tend to also have local funding). . . I made a Google Sheet of my own ranking of countries, from high (5) to low (1). . . Financial stuff . ABBA - Money Money, always a complicated issue.... . Not being rich, and having a middle-class family in a developing country like Peru, I could not finance a full study program + cost of living in Europe on my own. . Even though I had some savings from my work, I would have been barely enough for a year. . So I restricted my program search to two conditions: . Countries with (virtually) free education for non-europeans | Programs with (almost) full scholarships | . As for countries with virtually free education for non-europeans, that gave me . Germany | France | Belgium | Netherlands | Louxemburg | . The programs with (almost) full scholarships I had to search for in a university-by-university basis. . . Application requirements . There are some requirements that one can expect to always be requested, like proof of English proficiency. . However, other requirements, seem to be more a hassle to impede large numbers of students from applying: The GRE and the GMAT. . Though intended to somehow help admission offices, in reality, these exams are just a sham: there are courses and forums dedicated to passing them with good grades without actually being a knowledgeable student. . Additionally, preparation for taking those exams takes months, the exams themselves are somewhat expensive, and the conditions for sharing your grades for the applications processes you want are outright abusive. . These exams end up evaluating how much one has prepared for them. . For these reasons, I did not consider any programs that required either one of them, and oh, how much time and money have I saved! . . Available programs . By this time, I was thinking of going into Applied Mathematics (modelling, or PDEs. Very boring, I know). . Thus, I had to look up those universities that had Applied Mathematics programs. . . The legwork . With those guiding principles, my long search started. . Sources . I looked at two university rankings, filtered by country, and then searched for the top 15 to 20 universities in the country, for many European countries. . Also, I filtered by Area (Mathematics) and looked into the top 100 of them. . The rankings where: . The Shanghai ARWU ranking | The QS World University ranking | . . Screening process . Using the criteria of the guiding principles, I tried to make a list of those universities and programs that satisfied them. . At the beginning, for the first five universities I found, I tried to understand the whole application process, documents required, scholarship information, etc. Then I quickly noticed that that would not work: Every university had not only its own application criteria, but its own labyrinthine website. My strategy had to change. . My new method was to just quickly look at their available programs. . I wrote down on a Google Sheet all the universities that called my attention. I tried not to spent more than 10 minutes in a single university website. . BTW, French and German universities had the most disorganized and user unfriendly websites. . These took me around 3 months. I had to screen lots of universities. . The first list . My first list had around 100 surviving universities: . . The second list: More screening . From the first list, I started looking into their programs. I tried not to spend more than one hour in each university. This is where I filtered out those universities without applied math programs, and also those that asked for GRE/GMAT exams. . I also took a quick look at estimated prices, fees, and cost of living: . . Around thirty universities survived up to this point. . The final list: Refined filtering . With my second list ready, I started looking deep into the surviving universities&#39; programs: . Program: Courses, labs, projects, professors, etc. . Application process: Everything required to apply, even application fees. . In general: What programs seemed like a good fit for me, academically, financially, and personally. . The final list of Master&#39;s I decided to apply to was: . Mathmods: Joint Master in Mathematical Modelling in Engineering, in Germany, Italy, an/or France (As of 2020, it was an ex-Erasmus program with local funding) | COSSE: Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering, at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden, Germany, and/or the Netherlands. (As of 2020, it was an ex-Erasmus program with local funding) | Applied and Computational Mathematics: at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden. | Computational Science and Engineering: at Technische Universität Wien, in Austria. | . It took me months of screening to get to this point, but I really felt those places would be good for me. . You may notice something strange with that list, and I&#39;ll address it in the next section.... . . A surprise candidate . If you have read other parts of this blog, you surely have noticed something: . The Master&#39;s I ended up going to is not in the final list above! How could this be? . Here comes the story of how I ended up applying to the LCT Language and Communication Technologies Master&#39;s. . . The conversation . While traveling to meet friends abroad, I met a friend&#39;s friend who was a philosophy major with an interest in computing and we struck a conversation about the human Language potential. . We went about it for hours, eventually ignoring some of the other people around us. The topics ended up including philosophical logic, mathematical logic, foundations of mathematics, computation, linguistics, constructed languages, what the hell do A.I. and M.L do?, what&#39;s the role of proofs and programs? and so on. Eventually, he mentioned something called &quot;Computational linguistics&quot;, that nobody was quite sure what it meant, but it was a field in development. . This conversation made me realized that Applied Mathematics was something I could do, but that had moderate interest for me, and that my long dormant interest for languages was still there. Not only that, I was presented with a field that had a component from Humanities (through linguistics) and a component from mathematics (through programming), which was not Economics! (sorry, economists!) Even better, the field offered the chance to mix industry and research without necessarily going into academia. . . If I just could find a Master&#39;s in that area.... . The search . The conversation was in February 2020, and during the following days, I searched for Master&#39;s in Computational Linguistics. . After looking at the Erasmus Master&#39;s official list, I came across the LCT program. . It looked amazing for me, and it even had an scholarship! In a few hours I decided to apply. . I only had two weeks until the deadline! . Luckily, had already gotten my documents ready for the other applications (more info on getting documents ready in another post), so the effort of applying was minimal, and there was no application fee. . . The lesson . Was all my screening process worthless? . Not at all, it made clear to me what I expected from a Master&#39;s program to consider it at least decent. I got a feel of when a study path was not for me. . It helped me get ready for knowing about the most commonly requested documents. . The process made me realize that the Master&#39;s is a serious medium term project, and choosing well will influence a lot in my future. . And it gave me a list of satisfactory options for my future, and I avoided betting all into a single path. . . Note that at the end my list had now five candidates, and I prepared to apply to all of them. .",

            "content": "My journey to starting a Master&#39;s degree . I didn&#39;t just one day decide to apply to a Master&#39;s and got it. It was a long process. Let&#39;s see some of my journey before even applying to a Master&#39;s . During undergrad . Get good grades . It goes without saying, but good grades look really good in an application, but beyond that, ideally, they reflect that you learnt something during your undergrad, in the worst case, they reflect that you learnt to play the game of passing exams, but don&#39;t worry! Knowing how to play that kind of game will be helpful when navigating bureaucracy in the future! . Of course, unless they&#39;re truly astonishing, it is not enough to only have good grades. If you can show you can also do something, you&#39;ll have a better positioning than other students. I wish I had known this in the past. . . In my case, I was lucky that in professional Mathematics, the courses and exams in my university where made so that, if you passed them, it had to be because you at least learnt something. . Get undergraduate experience . You have to show you did something other than read books and pass exams. . Research can give you good experience during your undergraduate, this can also be activism or volunteering. In my case, I had a research project on Control Theory during my undergrad for some months. Don&#39;t be impressed, it was mainly about pointing out how there was a mistake in a proof by a not-that-well-known author. . Find out which areas you like . . Don&#39;t go in &quot;automatic mode&quot; passing courses, eventually, in your major, you&#39;ll find some things that pull your interest more than others, and that&#39;s ok, it&#39;s ok not to be a universal genius (sorry Leibniz, you put too much pressure on us mathematicians!). . In my case, I first studied Physics for some semesters before realizing that Mathematics was my thing, and even inside Math, I enjoyed far more algebra and logic than analysis (sorry again Lebiniz!). . . After undergraduate . . Work experience . . Ideally, your work will have something to do with the areas you got interested in during undergrad, or with the areas you intend to go to for your Master&#39;s. . Not everyone has the luck to have both, or even one. . In my case, my fist job did not start with either option. As I have detailed before, I started worked in Wolfram Research in a more Computer Science oriented project. Luckily, after a year or so, I could move into another project, more related with linguistics (and at this time I already had decided what Master&#39;s to apply to, but that will be for another post) I speculate that that helped me in my application process: There was concrete proof that someone trusted me with a project with an objective, deadlines, client requirements, etc, and that I did it (to the best of my ability). . Live . It was when my life did not revolve around my studies that I could better discern what I wanted to do with it. . Among scientists there&#39;s a bad custom of thinking your studies are your life (and internally your self-worth). This effectively destroys life-work/study balance, and is a recipe for missing on enormous amount of stuff. . Very curiously, it was while I was doing other hobbies that my mind was free of stress. And I say &quot;very curiously&quot; because my past self would devote everything to trying too hard to be too perfectionistic. . I then realized, I did not want to follow the predetermined route for mathematicians and scientists in general: . undergrad $ to$ master $ to$ doctorate $ to$ $N$ post-docs $ to$ tenure maaaaaaaybe . (&quot;$ to$&quot; means &quot; then immediately&quot;) . Nah, I wanted to do other stuff as well, not go into academia directly, and now I don&#39;t think I even want to go into it at all in the medium term. . Don&#39;t be too hard on yourself, follow a path not because it is the default, but because you chose to take it with the consequences it may have :) . So, hear my words: . . Quiêscere necesse est = to leisure is a necessity . . Andres Calamaro - Loco (Madman) . (chorus: I&#39;m a madman, that realized that time is too short) . Deciding I wanted to do a Master&#39;s degree . After my education I had a general base/idea of what different areas of Mathematics do. . But I felt like doing more than just the pure math I had been taught. . I felt like math should not be everything that I do, that I wanted to develop my other interests as well. . That meant I needed more training, so it was that I decided to do a Master&#39;s degree: in order to combine what I interested me with something math-related, and why not?, maybe get a better pay-grade with that. . Before this I thought about doing a Master&#39;s because &quot;it&#39;s what everyone here does&quot;, but now I had good personal reasons for doing it. . Thus I started searching for Master&#39;s. .",

            "title": "A little about me",
            "content": "A little about me . How did I get into my master? Sometimes I don&#39;t even know . I got accepted into the Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master, and many times I wonder if the committee made a mistake. Yep, impostor syndrome is my way of life for now. . . 1. My academic background . I studied at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the least catholic place in all of Peru and most forward thinking place in the country, a place truly dedicated to education, something remarkable when most universities in my country strive to be employee factories, but I digress.... . . My major was Mathematics. (wait, don&#39;t run!) . Though it was not my first option, I choose to major in Mathematics in order to learn how to learn, and along the way I worked a little in Control Theory, but my mathematical passion was in Mathematical Logic. One of the best decisions of my life :) . Now, you may think this makes a good segway into being good at Computer Science, but in fact I hated it. Or at least hated so much how it was taught to me, that I never bothered to learn it right. . In reality, I learned Mathematics through a &quot;pen and blackboard&quot; approach. Hopefully one day my professors will catch up with technology, but not in the foreseeable future. That&#39;s a result from the fact that being a mathematician is a very low-risk profession (I mean physically, not economically). . During my studies I got to do exchanges in Germany and Mexico, and summer courses in Brazil and U.S.A (funny, because summer in Brazil is from December to March, and in the USA it is from June to September) . All of this must sound amazing/impressive/intimidating, right? Well, only academically. My personal reality was really bad. For most of the time I was really depressed, my personal relationships where unattended, and I retracted to my own thoughts, which of course only worsened this cycle. . As it happens, doing Mathematics was a sort of good escapism: Reasoning about abstract concepts/objects helped me forget my problems and realize that there was beautiful stuff in life. . That must sound really strange, how can intangible stuff have an effect on someone? (that&#39;s a weird segway into Benacerraf&#39;s dilemma in the philosophy of Mathematics!) . The short version is that it was like looking at the sea for a long time: the vastness and uncaring-ness of what you&#39;re looking at is something that makes you realize that your problems are temporary, while the sea is not. . I also realized that Mathematics Academia was not a place for me: though I really like doing math, I also have other interests. I also wanted to have some savings before enrolling in graduate school, in order to not life off scholarships for many years. . And so, my graduation was at the end of 2018, with me not really knowing what I was going to do with my life. . . 2. Languages . Over the course of my life, I have always had an interest on human languages. When I was little, I would end up on Wikipedia for hours reading about how Basque is a language isolate, how some languages use clicks, constructed languages, reconstructed langauges, and so on, and on, and on.... . Being from the Peruvian coast, Spanish is my first language. The majority of Peruvians are monolinguals in Spanish, and so my upbringing was also like that. Sad, in a country with more than 30 indigenous languages. . First I studied English while I was around 13 to 16. My family insisted in registering me at a well-known English institute because of some non-sensical reasons like &quot;having a good CV&quot;. That institute was a waste of time and a money extractor for aspirational Peruvian families. I truly learned English watching stuff I really liked on Youtube, and then using English books for university. . For some years I tried to learn Ancient Greek at university. That&#39;s when I started attending classes at the Philosophy department. Though I studied really hard, I can hardly remember much now about the language itself, though it had it&#39;s advantages: . Greek made me go through the pain of learning a language with a case system, which was useful for the future | I&#39;m no longer intimidated by non-latin scripts | . Second I studied German when I was around 18. After a short 1-week journey to Germany I romanticized the country and wanted to study there in the future. That was the exchange I made when I was 21. Living there 6 months helped de-romanticize it, and I learned that every place has its own problems. . After studying German, the language-learning vice was already on motion. . Third I studied Quechua, the Ayacucho/Chanka variety, this is still in progress. Before you get surprised about that, after almost 4 years studying it on and off (too few people to get classes to open), I&#39;d say my level is still around A2-B1, keeping conversations is hard, I always forget the vocabulary, and can only read a couple of lines at a time. My reason for studying it was that I would not get a good chance to learn it if I left Peru. Learning it I saw the face of Peru that won&#39;t show on tourism ads: the social stigma against indigenous languages is strong in our classist peruvian society. I had to pay for the classes myself and I studied it in secret, because my parents had very strong negative opinions about that &quot;language of peasants&quot;. . Fourth I studied Portuguese. My main motivation here was that the program lasted a year and that that gave me a chance to study in Brazil. That was the summer course in made in Rio de Janeiro. Now, to many people that sounds idyllic, but the reality is different: Rio de Janeiro is the most unequal place I&#39;ve been to yet. Venturing outside the &quot;Zona Sul&quot; (South Zone, that&#39;s where all the famous beaches are) is where you&#39;ll see the true face of a strongly socioeconomically divided country. On the good side, long lasting friendships where made there :) . Fifth I started studying Latin, this is still in progress. My method is the wonderful Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata as a self learner. That&#39;s where I got the title for this blog btw, &quot;quiêscêns&quot; is the participle present of &quot;quiêscere&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;to relax, to leisure&quot;, so &quot;quiêscens&quot; means something like &quot;the one who relaxes/leisures&quot;. I&#39;m studying it because of all the tradition in philosophy and mathematics that&#39;s originally in Latin, but also as a relaxing exercise. . Sixth I started studying French, this is still in progress. To be honest, I have been indifferent to French culture all my life: I don&#39;t get why the media romanticizes it (specially USA media). Then, why did I started studying it? Well, I started after being accepted to my Master, the LCT program, and being assigned for my first year to the University of Lorraine. I&#39;ve then realized that the francophone countries of Africa look like really cool places to do some linguistics though. . . My goal is to get to be really fluent in 10 languages :) . 3. My work background . The three months after my graduation where very tense: my savings were diminishing and I needed to find a &quot;real job&quot;. . As it happens, some friends at university worked at Wolfram Research. After talking with some of the guys there, they recommended me to attend the Wolfram Summer School at Boston, USA. It lasted three weeks and was weirdly intellectually satisfying and socially challenging. The other participants were brilliant people from everywhere, and I made some lasting and non-lasting friendships there. The social issue was on me, because I put too much pressure on myself to &quot;keep up with the rest&quot;, which hindered my mental peace. Oh, how I wish I had known that! . After returning from the Summer School, I had an interview with the guy in charge of Wolfram Research South America, and the hired me. . . Those first months at Wolfram were very strong in imposter syndrome for me. I had no idea how to behave in a job environment, I had never programmed seriously (with a product for users in mind), and I got assigned a project strongly related to Computer Science (oh my!). . Thankfully, the environment and the people there were very relaxed, so my main source of stress was my own pressure to hide that I had no idea what I was doing. . With the months, I learned more and more, it was really in my second year that I got more confidence in my work. . That&#39;s when the pandemic arrived, and home-officing started. Working with all the mental load and uncertainty of the first months of quarantine was horrible. I hope never to be in that situation again. . After some months I asked to be relocated to a project more related to Linguistics, and my time there improved amazingly. Yeah, my algorithms where not very efficient, and some stuff had to be done manually, but I got it to work and even solved some bugs from many years ago! I did not notice the hours nor was as stressed as before in this new project. . Then, some weeks ago, I quit my job in order to make all the bureaucracy for starting the Masters. . 4. Choosing my masters . Though I will tell the complete story in another post, the summary is that I wanted to find a place where I could be &quot;in both worlds&quot; : Humanities + Sciences . I searched for a lot of places, like economics, to no result, I didn&#39;t really see myself doing that. . And one happy day, a friend told me about Computational Linguistics. This conversation started being about Logic and Philosophy of language, but when he started describing some ideas of the field, it was music to my ears. . In Computational linguistics I saw the chance to combine three interests . Humanities, through the social and philosophical sides from Linguistics | Sciences, through the Mathematics involved in technology (and that too many engineers gleefully are not aware of!) | Languages | . Plus the bonus of an allegedly good job market. . That&#39;s how I started searching for masters in Computational Linguistics, and eventually came upon Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master . 5. Holes in my formation . These are the things that I have meant to learn for a long time, because they would be helpful for my masters: . I have no idea about Python, R, or SQL | I have never done anything with machine learning | Computer Science (data structures and algorithms) make me wanna puke | Programming seriously is still very difficult for me | I don&#39;t have a formal education on Linguistics | I need more social confidence to work in groups | . I&#39;m really self-conscious about all of these. . Am I complaining that I have not yet learned the things I&#39;ll learn in the Masters? Sometimes I think that, but worrying about that kind of stuff is my specialty (not healthy, I know, I&#39;m working on it). . So yeah, that&#39;s partially me. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
