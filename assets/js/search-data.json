            "content": "Searching for a Master&#39;s to apply to . After deciding to do a Master&#39;s degree and before applying to some programs, I had to make a list of those Master&#39;s I would apply to. . Here&#39;s how I made my final list of four to five universities to study to. . This started one year before I actually applied to Master&#39;s programs. . This was a tedious part of the process, but it was my future what was at stake, so it was worth it. . Guiding principles . Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket: This is what I had in mind during this moment. . There&#39;s no guarantee the program of your dreams will have enough space, funding, or projects for you, so you need to diversify. Putting all your hopes into a dream program is a way of setting yourself up for disaster. . The more prudent way of doing it is to decide for many programs where you think you could be comfortable while studying a Master&#39;s degree of acceptable quality for you. I&#39;m not saying to have low-tier standards, instead I am saying that one has to be realistic: know thyself. . With that, here are the guiding principles for my search of Master&#39;s to apply to. . Places . From my personal history as well as future plans, I was sure I wanted to study in Europe, so I only looked for programs inside the countries of the European Union. . I&#39;m sure I missed a lot of good programs in the U.S.A, the U.K., Australia, Canada, Russia, and China, but that&#39;s the kind of compromise one has to make in order to fulfill some personal plans. . Luckily, there are a lot of universities to look at in the E.U. . Even luckier, the E.U. has Erasmus Master&#39;s, that take place in more than one country! I added those programs that either currently were Erasmus programs, or that had recently been Erasmus programs (because they tend to also have local funding). . . I made a Google Sheet of my own ranking of countries, from high (5) to low (1). . . Financial stuff . Money, always a complicated issue.... . Not being rich, and having a middle-class family in a developing country like Peru, I could not finance a full study program + cost of living in Europe on my own. . Even though I had some savings from my work, I would have been barely enough for a year. . So I restricted my program search to two conditions: . Countries with (virtually) free education for non-europeans | Programs with (almost) full scholarships | . As for countries with virtually free education for non-europeans, that gave me . Germany | France | Belgium | Netherlands | Louxemburg | . The programs with (almost) full scholarships I had to search for in a university-by-university basis. . . Application requirements . There are some requirements that one can expect to always be requested, like proof of English proficiency. . However, other requirements, seem to be more a hassle to impede large numbers of students from applying: The GRE and the GMAT. . Though intended to somehow help admission offices, in reality, these exams are just a sham: there are courses and forums dedicated to passing them with good grades without actually being a knowledgeable student. . Additionally, preparation for taking those exams takes months, the exams themselves are somewhat expensive, and the conditions for sharing your grades for the applications processes you want are outright abusive. . These exams end up evaluating how much one has prepared for them. . For these reasons, I did not consider any programs that required either one of them, and oh, how much time and money have I saved! . . Available programs . By this time, I was thinking of going into Applied Mathematics (modelling, or PDEs. Very boring, I know). . Thus, I had to look up those universities that had Applied Mathematics programs. . . The legwork . With those guiding principles, my long search started. . Sources . I looked at two university rankings, filtered by country, and then searched for the top 15 to 20 universities in the country, for many European countries. . Also, I filtered by Area (Mathematics) and looked into the top 100 of them. . The rankings where: . The Shanghai ARWU ranking | The QS World University ranking | . . Screening process . Using the criteria of the guiding principles, I tried to make a list of those universities and programs that satisfied them. . At the beginning, for the first five universities I found, I tried to understand the whole application process, documents required, scholarship information, etc. Then I quickly noticed that that would not work: Every university had not only its own application criteria, but its own labyrinthine website. My strategy had to change. . My new method was to just quickly look at their available programs. . I wrote down on a Google Sheet all the universities that called my attention. I tried not to spent more than 10 minutes in a single university website. . BTW, French and German universities had the most disorganized and user unfriendly websites. . These took me around 3 months. I had to screen lots of universities. . The first list . My first list had around 100 surviving universities: . . The second list: More screening . From the first list, I started looking into their programs. I tried not to spend more than one hour in each university. This is where I filtered out those universities without applied math programs, and also those that asked for GRE/GMAT exams. . I also took a quick look at estimated prices, fees, and cost of living: . . Around thirty universities survived up to this point. . The final list: Refined filtering . With my second list ready, I started looking deep into the surviving universities&#39; programs: . Program: Courses, labs, projects, professors, etc. . Application process: Everything required to apply, even application fees. . In general: What programs seemed like a good fit for me, academically, financially, and personally. . The final list of Master&#39;s I decided to apply to was: . Mathmods: Joint Master in Mathematical Modelling in Engineering, in Germany, Italy, an/or France (As of 2020, it was an ex-Erasmus program with local funding) | COSSE: Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering, at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden, Germany, and/or the Netherlands. (As of 2020, it was an ex-Erasmus program with local funding) | Applied and Computational Mathematics: at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Sweden. | Computational Science and Engineering: at Technische Universität Wien, in Austria. | . It took me months of screening to get to this point, but I really felt those places would be good for me. . You may notice something strange with that list, and I&#39;ll address it in the next section.... . . A surprise candidate . If you have read other parts of this blog, you surely have noticed something: . The Master&#39;s I ended up going to is not in the final list above! How could this be? . Here comes the story of how I ended up applying to the LCT Language and Communication Technologies Master&#39;s. . . The conversation . While traveling to meet friends abroad, I met a friend&#39;s friend who was a philosophy major with an interest in computing and we struck a conversation about the human Language potential. . We went about it for hours, eventually ignoring some of the other people around us. The topics ended up including philosophical logic, mathematical logic, foundations of mathematics, computation, linguistics, constructed languages, what the hell do A.I. and M.L do?, what&#39;s the role of proofs and programs? and so on. Eventually, he mentioned something called &quot;Computational linguistics&quot;, that nobody was quite sure what it meant, but it was a field in development. . This conversation made me realized that Applied Mathematics was something I could do, but that had moderate interest for me, and that my long dormant interest for languages was still there. Not only that, I was presented with a field that had a component from Humanities (through linguistics) and a component from mathematics (through programming), which was not Economics! (sorry, economists!) Even better, the field offered the chance to mix industry and research without necessarily going into academia. . . If I just could find a Master&#39;s in that area.... . The search . The conversation was in February 2020, and during the following days, I searched for Master&#39;s in Computational Linguistics. . After looking at the Erasmus Master&#39;s official list, I came across the LCT program. . It looked amazing for me, and it even had an scholarship! In a few hours I decided to apply. . I only had two weeks until the deadline! . Luckily, had already gotten my documents ready for the other applications (more info on getting documents ready in another post), so the effort of applying was minimal, and there was no application fee. . . The lesson . Was all my screening process worthless? . Not at all, it made clear to me what I expected from a Master&#39;s program to consider it at least decent. I got a feel of when a study path was not for me. . It helped me get ready for knowing about the most commonly requested documents. . The process made me realize that the Master&#39;s is a serious medium term project, and choosing well will influence a lot in my future. . And it gave me a list of satisfactory options for my future, and I avoided betting all into a single path. . . Note that at the end my list had now five candidates, and I prepared to apply to all of them. .",

            "content": "My journey to starting a Master&#39;s degree . I didn&#39;t just one day decide to apply to a Master&#39;s and got it. It was a long process. Let&#39;s see some of my journey before even applying to a Master&#39;s . During undergrad . Get good grades . It goes without saying, but good grades look really good in an application, but beyond that, ideally, they reflect that you learnt something during your undergrad, in the worst case, they reflect that you learnt to play the game of passing exams, but don&#39;t worry! Knowing how to play that kind of game will be helpful when navigating bureaucracy in the future! . Of course, unless they&#39;re truly astonishing, it is not enough to only have good grades. If you can show you can also do something, you&#39;ll have a better positioning than other students. I wish I had known this in the past. . . In my case, I was lucky that in professional Mathematics, the courses and exams in my university where made so that, if you passed them, it had to be because you at least learnt something. . Get undergraduate experience . You have to show you did something other than read books and pass exams. . Research can give you good experience during your undergraduate, this can also be activism or volunteering. In my case, I had a research project on Control Theory during my undergrad for some months. Don&#39;t be impressed, it was mainly about pointing out how there was a mistake in a proof by a not-that-well-known author. . Find out which areas you like . . Don&#39;t go in &quot;automatic mode&quot; passing courses, eventually, in your major, you&#39;ll find some things that pull your interest more than others, and that&#39;s ok, it&#39;s ok not to be a universal genius (sorry Leibniz, you put too much pressure on us mathematicians!). . In my case, I first studied Physics for some semesters before realizing that Mathematics was my thing, and even inside Math, I enjoyed far more algebra and logic than analysis (sorry again Lebiniz!). . . After undergraduate . . Work experience . . Ideally, your work will have something to do with the areas you got interested in during undergrad, or with the areas you intend to go to for your Master&#39;s. . Not everyone has the luck to have both, or even one. . In my case, my fist job did not start with either option. As I have detailed before, I started worked in Wolfram Research in a more Computer Science oriented project. Luckily, after a year or so, I could move into another project, more related with linguistics (and at this time I already had decided what Master&#39;s to apply to, but that will be for another post) I speculate that that helped me in my application process: There was concrete proof that someone trusted me with a project with an objective, deadlines, client requirements, etc, and that I did it (to the best of my ability). . Live . It was when my life did not revolve around my studies that I could better discern what I wanted to do with it. . Among scientists there&#39;s a bad custom of thinking your studies are your life (and internally your self-worth). This effectively destroys life-work/study balance, and is a recipe for missing on enormous amount of stuff. . Very curiously, it was while I was doing other hobbies that my mind was free of stress. And I say &quot;very curiously&quot; because my past self would devote everything to trying too hard to be too perfectionistic. . I then realized, I did not want to follow the predetermined route for mathematicians and scientists in general: . undergrad $ to$ master $ to$ doctorate $ to$ $N$ post-docs $ to$ tenure maaaaaaaybe . (&quot;$ to$&quot; means &quot; then immediately&quot;) . Nah, I wanted to do other stuff as well, not go into academia directly, and now I don&#39;t think I even want to go into it at all in the medium term. . Don&#39;t be too hard on yourself, follow a path not because it is the default, but because you chose to take it with the consequences it may have :) . So, hear my words: . . Quiêscere necesse est = to leisure is a necessity . . . (chorus: I&#39;m a madman, that realized that time is too short) . Deciding I wanted to do a Master&#39;s degree . After my education I had a general base/idea of what different areas of Mathematics do. . But I felt like doing more than just the pure math I had been taught. . I felt like math should not be everything that I do, that I wanted to develop my other interests as well. . That meant I needed more training, so it was that I decided to do a Master&#39;s degree: in order to combine what I interested me with something math-related, and why not?, maybe get a better pay-grade with that. . Before this I thought about doing a Master&#39;s because &quot;it&#39;s what everyone here does&quot;, but now I had good personal reasons for doing it. . Thus I started searching for Master&#39;s. .",

            "title": "A little about me",
            "content": "A little about me . How did I get into my master? Sometimes I don&#39;t even know . I got accepted into the Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master, and many times I wonder if the committee made a mistake. Yep, impostor syndrome is my way of life for now. . . 1. My academic background . I studied at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the least catholic place in all of Peru and most forward thinking place in the country, a place truly dedicated to education, something remarkable when most universities in my country strive to be employee factories, but I digress.... . . My major was Mathematics. (wait, don&#39;t run!) . Though it was not my first option, I choose to major in Mathematics in order to learn how to learn, and along the way I worked a little in Control Theory, but my mathematical passion was in Mathematical Logic. One of the best decisions of my life :) . Now, you may think this makes a good segway into being good at Computer Science, but in fact I hated it. Or at least hated so much how it was taught to me, that I never bothered to learn it right. . In reality, I learned Mathematics through a &quot;pen and blackboard&quot; approach. Hopefully one day my professors will catch up with technology, but not in the foreseeable future. That&#39;s a result from the fact that being a mathematician is a very low-risk profession (I mean physically, not economically). . During my studies I got to do exchanges in Germany and Mexico, and summer courses in Brazil and U.S.A (funny, because summer in Brazil is from December to March, and in the USA it is from June to September) . All of this must sound amazing/impressive/intimidating, right? Well, only academically. My personal reality was really bad. For most of the time I was really depressed, my personal relationships where unattended, and I retracted to my own thoughts, which of course only worsened this cycle. . As it happens, doing Mathematics was a sort of good escapism: Reasoning about abstract concepts/objects helped me forget my problems and realize that there was beautiful stuff in life. . That must sound really strange, how can intangible stuff have an effect on someone? (that&#39;s a weird segway into Benacerraf&#39;s dilemma in the philosophy of Mathematics!) . The short version is that it was like looking at the sea for a long time: the vastness and uncaring-ness of what you&#39;re looking at is something that makes you realize that your problems are temporary, while the sea is not. . I also realized that Mathematics Academia was not a place for me: though I really like doing math, I also have other interests. I also wanted to have some savings before enrolling in graduate school, in order to not life off scholarships for many years. . And so, my graduation was at the end of 2018, with me not really knowing what I was going to do with my life. . . 2. Languages . Over the course of my life, I have always had an interest on human languages. When I was little, I would end up on Wikipedia for hours reading about how Basque is a language isolate, how some languages use clicks, constructed languages, reconstructed langauges, and so on, and on, and on.... . Being from the Peruvian coast, Spanish is my first language. The majority of Peruvians are monolinguals in Spanish, and so my upbringing was also like that. Sad, in a country with more than 30 indigenous languages. . First I studied English while I was around 13 to 16. My family insisted in registering me at a well-known English institute because of some non-sensical reasons like &quot;having a good CV&quot;. That institute was a waste of time and a money extractor for aspirational Peruvian families. I truly learned English watching stuff I really liked on Youtube, and then using English books for university. . For some years I tried to learn Ancient Greek at university. That&#39;s when I started attending classes at the Philosophy department. Though I studied really hard, I can hardly remember much now about the language itself, though it had it&#39;s advantages: . Greek made me go through the pain of learning a language with a case system, which was useful for the future | I&#39;m no longer intimidated by non-latin scripts | . Second I studied German when I was around 18. After a short 1-week journey to Germany I romanticized the country and wanted to study there in the future. That was the exchange I made when I was 21. Living there 6 months helped de-romanticize it, and I learned that every place has its own problems. . After studying German, the language-learning vice was already on motion. . Third I studied Quechua, the Ayacucho/Chanka variety, this is still in progress. Before you get surprised about that, after almost 4 years studying it on and off (too few people to get classes to open), I&#39;d say my level is still around A2-B1, keeping conversations is hard, I always forget the vocabulary, and can only read a couple of lines at a time. My reason for studying it was that I would not get a good chance to learn it if I left Peru. Learning it I saw the face of Peru that won&#39;t show on tourism ads: the social stigma against indigenous languages is strong in our classist peruvian society. I had to pay for the classes myself and I studied it in secret, because my parents had very strong negative opinions about that &quot;language of peasants&quot;. . Fourth I studied Portuguese. My main motivation here was that the program lasted a year and that that gave me a chance to study in Brazil. That was the summer course in made in Rio de Janeiro. Now, to many people that sounds idyllic, but the reality is different: Rio de Janeiro is the most unequal place I&#39;ve been to yet. Venturing outside the &quot;Zona Sul&quot; (South Zone, that&#39;s where all the famous beaches are) is where you&#39;ll see the true face of a strongly socioeconomically divided country. On the good side, long lasting friendships where made there :) . Fifth I started studying Latin, this is still in progress. My method is the wonderful Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata as a self learner. That&#39;s where I got the title for this blog btw, &quot;quiêscêns&quot; is the participle present of &quot;quiêscere&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;to relax, to leisure&quot;, so &quot;quiêscens&quot; means something like &quot;the one who relaxes/leisures&quot;. I&#39;m studying it because of all the tradition in philosophy and mathematics that&#39;s originally in Latin, but also as a relaxing exercise. . Sixth I started studying French, this is still in progress. To be honest, I have been indifferent to French culture all my life: I don&#39;t get why the media romanticizes it (specially USA media). Then, why did I started studying it? Well, I started after being accepted to my Master, the LCT program, and being assigned for my first year to the University of Lorraine. I&#39;ve then realized that the francophone countries of Africa look like really cool places to do some linguistics though. . . My goal is to get to be really fluent in 10 languages :) . 3. My work background . The three months after my graduation where very tense: my savings were diminishing and I needed to find a &quot;real job&quot;. . As it happens, some friends at university worked at Wolfram Research. After talking with some of the guys there, they recommended me to attend the Wolfram Summer School at Boston, USA. It lasted three weeks and was weirdly intellectually satisfying and socially challenging. The other participants were brilliant people from everywhere, and I made some lasting and non-lasting friendships there. The social issue was on me, because I put too much pressure on myself to &quot;keep up with the rest&quot;, which hindered my mental peace. Oh, how I wish I had known that! . After returning from the Summer School, I had an interview with the guy in charge of Wolfram Research South America, and the hired me. . . Those first months at Wolfram were very strong in imposter syndrome for me. I had no idea how to behave in a job environment, I had never programmed seriously (with a product for users in mind), and I got assigned a project strongly related to Computer Science (oh my!). . Thankfully, the environment and the people there were very relaxed, so my main source of stress was my own pressure to hide that I had no idea what I was doing. . With the months, I learned more and more, it was really in my second year that I got more confidence in my work. . That&#39;s when the pandemic arrived, and home-officing started. Working with all the mental load and uncertainty of the first months of quarantine was horrible. I hope never to be in that situation again. . After some months I asked to be relocated to a project more related to Linguistics, and my time there improved amazingly. Yeah, my algorithms where not very efficient, and some stuff had to be done manually, but I got it to work and even solved some bugs from many years ago! I did not notice the hours nor was as stressed as before in this new project. . Then, some weeks ago, I quit my job in order to make all the bureaucracy for starting the Masters. . 4. Choosing my masters . Though I will tell the complete story in another post, the summary is that I wanted to find a place where I could be &quot;in both worlds&quot; : Humanities + Sciences . I searched for a lot of places, like economics, to no result, I didn&#39;t really see myself doing that. . And one happy day, a friend told me about Computational Linguistics. This conversation started being about Logic and Philosophy of language, but when he started describing some ideas of the field, it was music to my ears. . In Computational linguistics I saw the chance to combine three interests . Humanities, through the social and philosophical sides from Linguistics | Sciences, through the Mathematics involved in technology (and that too many engineers gleefully are not aware of!) | Languages | . Plus the bonus of an allegedly good job market. . That&#39;s how I started searching for masters in Computational Linguistics, and eventually came upon Language and Communication Technologies Erasmus Master . 5. Holes in my formation . These are the things that I have meant to learn for a long time, because they would be helpful for my masters: . I have no idea about Python, R, or SQL | I have never done anything with machine learning | Computer Science (data structures and algorithms) make me wanna puke | Programming seriously is still very difficult for me | I don&#39;t have a formal education on Linguistics | I need more social confidence to work in groups | . I&#39;m really self-conscious about all of these. . Am I complaining that I have not yet learned the things I&#39;ll learn in the Masters? Sometimes I think that, but worrying about that kind of stuff is my specialty (not healthy, I know, I&#39;m working on it). . So yeah, that&#39;s partially me. .",

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
